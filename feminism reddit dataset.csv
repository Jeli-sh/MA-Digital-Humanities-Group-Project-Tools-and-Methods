I constantly see him watching his videos so I decided to look into what he preaches in his videos.

From what I saw he was just bragging about his sex life in uni and saying that working out is the ‚Äúeasiest way‚Äù to attracting women and that working women are far less happy then housewives. He also constantly body shames people saying that if they aren‚Äôt in shape they are ‚ÄúJeffrey‚Äôs‚Äù(some sort of red pill insult)

I was horrified by this and asked my brother to stop watching him and embrace feminism and it‚Äôs ok to be more feminine, he looked at me as if I was dumb and said he had no feminine traits and said that going to the gym, being more masculine and the red pill is the only path for men to take. I felt very disturbed by this as I know he also listens to Andrew Tate , when I asked him about that he just said that he taught good ways to make money as he was a business man.

Right now I don‚Äôt know what to do as a lot of what he‚Äôs watching is challenging our feminist views and I‚Äôm scared he‚Äôll turn into a misogynist.",1672626944.0,2023-01-02 02:35:44+00:00

7,Being a teen girl sucks,236,100ofn7,Feminism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/100ofn7/being_a_teen_girl_sucks/,12,"As I am in my last year of highschool and am going off to college full time, I‚Äôve finally placed the words in my own head about how my family treats me. It has been this weird dynamic for years where my parents are constantly displeased/ outright aggressive with me. 

Everything I do is analyzed. Every face I make or vocal note of displeasure is taken as this affirmation that I‚Äôm a hormonal moody monster that will lash out when not attended to or appeased. Simautaneously, I have to show my appreciation visually at every move my parents make. I have to affirm that they‚Äôre doing everything perfectly as my parents and that I am constantly pleased with them. 

Like if I‚Äôm quiet, I‚Äôm being a passive aggressive bitch. If I‚Äôm constantly smiling, I‚Äôm faking it. If I voice my opinions after being constantly analyzed and show any feelings, I‚Äôm over-emotional 

I have four (!) brothers and none of them are treated like this. The three younger than me have mentioned how weirdly my parents treat me about the same actions . One of my brothers is very neutral and stoic, but if I am the same, even momentarily, I‚Äôve unleashed the monstrous force of hormones and depression onto everyone. I don‚Äôt even have a resting ‚Äòmean‚Äô face so it‚Äôs especially strange.

It‚Äôs weird, because both parents participate in this, and maybe it‚Äôs just my family. But the double standard of me being a horrible teenager is maddening.",1672594125.0,2023-01-01 17:28:45+00:00
8,Is the whole thing a lie?,31,100yxd9,Feminism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/100yxd9/is_the_whole_thing_a_lie/,10,"I've gone through hell this year. It has made me think deeply about my experiences as a woman, which are not very unique. Almost every woman I have met can relate to dealing with an abusive man, or being objectified in public, or being sexualized when they were just little girls by older men. Scrolling through social media comments these days is enlightening and seems to reveal a lot about what men think about women.

Every guy I've met has sooner or later revealed to me that they believe women are biologically submissive and should adhere to men's expectations of courtship and reproduction. Every man, even the nice ones who seem intelligent, have revealed that breaking away from husband-and-wife traditions by allowing women to participate in paid careers, is ruining the economy and society in some way. They inevitably end up pointing to the violence in our modern-day society, and blame much of these modern-day problems on women gaining their independence in the West. Then, they will reveal that they think women have an easy, spoon-fed life, and that we have no reasons to participate in feminism. If this was one or two guys, I would not be so worried. However, it's practically every man I have gotten to know, and some of them have even masqueraded in human-rights advocacy whilst also holding these beliefs about women.

The more that I pay attention, the more that I truly believe that men have been programmed to view women this way. The programming is so strong that I'm not confident that many men, if any, break away from this toxic line of thinking. Studies confirm that men are less empathetic than women. Isn't that enough of a reason not to date them? But, we are encouraged to locate ""the One"" and live happily-ever-after raising Little Johnny and Little Susy, further sacrificing our individual needs for ""the greater good"" of our communities, and our men, who work so very hard and are entitled to sleep with us pretty much whenever the need arises.

Dating in this climate seems dangerous, because inevitably, a man with this belief-system will be attracted. He'll be nice to you at first and even present himself as being patient and fair, but as soon as you move into together, you begin to realize how much these men want a woman who will be a submissive and constantly sexually-active wifey. All the while, they will fail to emphasize with your feelings on the subject, because they lack a strong compass of empathy - Therefore, your needs will never be met. It's extremely exhausting for women, and yet we also get berated for sounding like a feminist. Feminism has become a dirty word. God forbid you have an opinion about your own sex - If you do, you must be a feminist, right? They put you down for standing up for yourself.

I have reason to believe that women were subjugated a very long time ago, our history was erased along with our maiden names, that we were used to free labor in agriculture, construction, the sex-trade, and in domestic duties without a political voice and with the inability to obtain education, selected for breeding/eugenics, reduced to our biological functions, and that we were actively encouraged to compete with one another instead of uniting. Then, all of this was further enforced by religion, and the archaic beliefs about women continues to propagate the modern-day. If anyone knows of books and historical accounts that confirm this, post below.

Realizing that I was lied to my whole life, I am so grateful to have the option to remain single and free from this narrative of ""biology"", ""hierarchy"", and ""order"" forever. If I hear another man use these terms, I am running for the hills.",1672621242.0,2023-01-02 01:00:42+00:00

**Hello everyone!**

We are looking to add some new moderators to our moderation team, and are accepting applications now. The positions would start as junior mods before moving into full moderation duties.

The junior mod position would include helping remove comments and posts that are off topic, with other moderation duties to follow.

**What we are looking for in a junior moderator:**

*Investment in feminism!* - We don‚Äôt require you to have an academic background in women's issues, although that is welcome. We do require you identify as a feminist, and all ages (over 18), nationalities and genders are welcome. If you are part of a vulnerable community please note this as well, as increasing the diversity of our team is a priority. Applicants must be active in feminist/progressive forums, and their account should be at least 3 months old.

*Constructive attitude* - No history of hate speech including transphobia, ableism, ageism, sexism etc

*Ability to work individually and with a team* -  our moderation team functions in English. While fluency in other languages is very welcome, a junior mod should be able to communicate constructively with an English speaking team.


**If you are interested (and we do welcome all applications!) please [send a message to the moderation team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/Feminism) that includes:**

*Account age, preferred pronouns*. We won‚Äôt be able to accept new accounts or those with little to no post history.

*Timezone and expected availability* 

*A brief background on your feminism.* This can include issues that are important to you, previous activism, or why you are interested in joining the team. 

Feel free to add anything you might feel is relevant and could add to your application or help us get to know you; if we have any further questions, we will let you know.

Thank you everyone for being such a wonderful and engaged community, and we look forward to seeing your thoughts.

Cheers!",1672640836.0,2023-01-02 06:27:16+00:00

It's both a cutting critique of the silliness of Shakespearean romance, and a celebration of true, egalitarian, 'feminist' romance at the same time; and written by, for, and about a bloke, too, on top of all that ü§™.

So in that vein, I wanted to share a little thought, my own personal 'motto' on life, which is, in my opinion, how one can be both positive, and angry, at the same time: 

   *""Contentment is a SKILL, it is not an achievement. It is a METHOD, and not a goal. You will never 'reach' contentment, no matter how hard you run toward it.

The trick is to slow down, walk carefully and thoughtfully, and analyse everything you find critically, sceptically, but with total self-honesy, and hey presto, there contenment lies, you have caught it at last.

Unless you can convince yourself you are 'good enough' already, improving yourself, and caring about others, will be nearly impossible.""*

By this point the only posts recommended to me by my Reddit feed is the female body, often nude or in a suggestive pose, because these are the ones getting the most upvotes.

I'm not saying this to sound like a prude or that I'm against sexuality, by the way. Hopefully that's obvious. My issue stems from the fact that these posts are the ones getting the most attention, that the anatomy is always exaggerated/downright incorrect and these issues are ignored because \~it's their style\~. I rarely see anything else on my home page, subscribed to many art subreddits. It's just become drawings of, well, *pornography*. I promise I'm not saying this as an exaggeration, lots of these art pieces are focused on the women having sex.

It's become to the point where I'm starting to feel uncomfortable going somewhere such as r/drawing. It's gotten so bad. It's all I'm getting shown, while other pieces are getting ignored most of the time. I tried posting a sexual art piece of a man on there and other subreddits once, and although it wasn't my best piece it was similar to the ones getting a lot of upvotes, but it must've gotten only one or two upvotes and multiple downvotes. A sexual piece of a man in a similar skill range of a lot of the sexual art pieces of women posted.

It seeks to understand how the state, as a political and legal institution, contributes to the marginalization and oppression of women and how it can be transformed to promote gender equality.

Feminist theorists have critiqued traditional theories of the state, which have often assumed that the state is a neutral and impartial arbiter of justice. They argue that the state is not neutral, but rather is shaped by the social, cultural, and economic context in which it operates, and that it often reflects and reinforces the dominant values and interests of those in power.

In hindsight, this was incredibly foolish because I didn‚Äôt know who I was. 

I‚Äôve been married to my current husband for almost 4 years. I have grown and changed a lot these past 4 years. I‚Äôve started a business, refinanced my home in my own name, and have learned to be an independent woman. I now realize the the ways in which I was taken advantage of, manipulated, and oppressed as a woman in a fundamental church. 

When I met my husband he had his own house and cooked/cleaned/mowed grass at his house. We couldn‚Äôt live together until we were married (it was in the court order with my ex). Now I find myself doing EVERYTHING including cleaning the litter box of HIS cat that I don‚Äôt even like. If I don‚Äôt do it, it just won‚Äôt get done.

So I'm from the sexually repressed country Oman and saying that slut-shaming is prevalent would be a big understatement, if you are a woman who expresses any kind of sexual desire (even for your own husband) you have to fear violence. 

The outcome is that since the men have convinced themselves that a good muslimah practically doesn't have desires she also doesn't have sexual needs, therefore they don't have to worry about pleasing her. Sex is mostly regarded even by women as something that is done to conceive children and to please the husband. Sex is also not seen as something that you have together but something the man does to his wive and she endures it. 

Most women I've talked to don't know that a orgasm durring sex is possible. Sex is also seen as the duty of the wife and this all creates an enviroment in which men can have sex with their wives whenever they want and however they want. 

This has never made sense to me, why would Allah give women the ability to lust for and enjoy sex but then supposedly condemn them for doing so. But as long as it is men and men only who interpret the holy texts, they will do so in their favor.",1672240421.0,2022-12-28 15:13:41+00:00

i did get back at them saying that misogyny is exactly the reason why supply and demand are skewed and that women are being exploited or pushed into not getting a membership by the high prices and that in itself is misogyny.

I am looking for suggestions on something to read that discusses a topic I'm interested in. I recently finished reading Intercourse by Andrea Dworkin and Why I Am Not A Feminist: A Feminist Manifesto by Jessa Crispin.

In *Intercourse*, in chapter 7, Dworkin touches on Victoria Woodhull's idea about equality in relationships- Dworkin says that Woodhull says that because intercourse itself is a violation of a woman's boundaries (i.e., literal penetration also has a symbolic meaning in which the entered / violated is lesser in the relationship), BECAUSE OF THIS, women must be the absolute authority/ leader in the sexual realm of the relationship in order to even things out. Basically, that she's inevitably (if the couple ever has sex) going to be owned (and therefore not equal) physically, so in order for the relationship to be equal, the couple has to make her not just a consenter but the initiator of all sex, which would provide her with ownership as well.

It's not hard to see that this is the inspiration for Bumble but I was wondering if anyone knows of any books that expand more on this idea/ use the assertion that the woman is owned in intercourse as a jumping-off point for thinking about how to achieve equality in heterosexual relationships? 

I looked up Victoria Woodhull and found out that she was once a presidential candidate, but not really an author.

Or if you have other reading suggestions feel free to pass those along.

I'm not very interested in those in psychoanalytic discourse encouraging immediate and free satisfaction of impulses.

But rather, I'm more interested in sociological perspective - impact of culture (toxic masculinity, pornography etc.) on shaping men's desires and attitudes towards sexual intercourse and women.

I'm interested in a bigger picture of those influences that would include social and economic systems, dogmas and symbols maintaining them etc.

I'm going to keep this vague so that hopefully it relates to as many of you as possible! Sorry in advance for the verbose-ness.

I am the only woman at my workplace. I notice my male coworkers not doing work during shifts a decent amount (sitting outside, socializing, on their phone). But it's not that they do that or the amount of time that they spend doing that others me. I do those things too when I can. What I'm struggling with is our Manager's (2 of them) response to it. They are both male as well. I feel that any time I am seen without an active task, I get stern looks and a list of things for just me to do. And I've never seen that happen to my coworkers when they aren't working, even though they spend more time on breaks than I do. But maybe it does happen to them and I just don't see it? 

It's a fairly common occurrence for me to be given a task to do next, while working on a task already, while my coworkers are actively doing nothing work related.
Part of that is me, for sure. I say yes most of the time, and seek out new tasks to do. But when I exhibit what I feel is the same behavior as my colleagues, I get backlash from it. 

I worked pretty hard to make sure I wasn't being taken advantage of by my coworkers with the same job title and responsibilities  - but it still seems to be coming from management. 

A quick Google search didn't really give me any information on this topic. Is this something other women experience? Or is it just my egocentric bias making me feel like I have to work harder than my coworkers when I actually don't?",1671925427.0,2022-12-24 23:43:47+00:00

87,Muted Group Theory Explained,1,zuwrv7,Feminism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/zuwrv7/muted_group_theory_explained/,0,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/13hh951j918a1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=423468b51087c81153c084abeac076572300a980

Have you ever experienced something hard to describe because no words represent it? Are you just recently able to express something with recently popularized terminology such as gaslighting, victim-blaming, heteronormativity, and so on?

Are you tired of other people teasing you with their fantasies/projections about you that prevent you from communicating your true thoughts? Do people often dismiss your ideas because of your identity?

These are everyday examples of muted group theory.

Muted group theory is a theory that states that marginalized groups must change the way they communicate, and their true perspectives are often ignored. This might be due to several factors:

&#x200B;

**1. The vocabulary of their language cannot accommodate their way of thinking, feeling, behaviour, and describing an experience.**

Since the language is created by the dominant group, hence the vocabulary is centered on accommodating the dominant group.

As you can see, the words gaslighting, victim-blaming, mansplaining, stimming, neurodiversity, or even executive function are just recently popularized. Before that, you may have trouble describing or even identifying your experience since you didn't know those terminologies. Or you may have to say a paragraph to mention something that can be told in a single word.

For example, if somebody gaslighted you (gaslighting means manipulating you into making you no longer trust your mind, feeling, and experience). If somebody gaslighted you, would you rather say: ""they're manipulating me into making me no longer trust my mind, feeling, and experience.""

or you can just say

""they're gaslighting me.""

Which one is more effective? You are more likely to say, ""they're gaslighting me"", especially if the word gaslighting is already well-known.

Some experiences that don't have a term might be frustrating to describe and can be hard to find other people who can relate to. Because you can't even find words to effectively describe it.

That's why vocabularies are essential. And if somebody use foreign terms, we shouldn't pass judgment too soon. Just ask what the terms mean. The person should want to explain what the terms means so more people will understand the terms.

&#x200B;

**2. False projections towards marginalized groups.**

Projection means someone attributing or exaggerating certain traits or imagination towards another person and forcing it to appear real.

This, for example, occurred in my country, Indonesia. When a girl and a boy walk together, people frequently assume they are in a romantic relationship, even when they don't show any verbal or non-verbal signs of being in a romantic relationship. People often tease or project their imagination to a girl and a boy who hang out together. Yeah, heteronormativity is too obvious here.

Another example in my place is when a guy just graduated, and he didn't or not have a plan about continue to graduate school. Older people who talk to him (like parents, teachers/lecturers, relatives) might ask where they might work or whether they build a business and give some suggestions about it.

While a gal (gal means woman) didn't or not have the plan to continue to graduate school. Older people (like parents, relatives, or even teachers/lecturers) are likelier to say jokingly or seriously about when she gets married and continue talking about it, despite the gal saying she doesn't want to talk about it. That's the projection differences based on gender.

False projection towards someone can hinder them from expressing their ideas.

Even after the person has communicated their thought, the responder may misrepresent their thought based on their projection. Like when you said something, the responder purposely answered and even restated it, with different emphasis and different meaning from your real intention.

For example, somebody telling about their sexual harassment experience. From one of their sentences, we know that the perpetrator happened to be a male. But the person mostly talked about how traumatized and horrified they are by the harassment. Instead of sympathizing or validating their feelings, the responder replied with defensive words like ""not all men are perpetrators"". That's true that not all men are perpetrators, but is this genuinely addressing and conveying what the person is trying to imply?

&#x200B;

**3. Gatekeeping of the marginalized groups**

Gatekeeping has occurred throughout history and continues to exist now. From women not being able to vote until the nineteenth century. Marginalized and minority groups are still less likely to be heard in the most discussion and consensus. Let alone getting sufficient voters to be in parliament and governmental position.

&#x200B;

**4. Differences in gesture and intonation.**

Some people in the dominant group, usually referring to males, might overreact and easily burst with anger or threats. Especially if the more marginalized, like woman and AFAB (assigned female at birth), express their opinions with manner that is considered less feminine. Like having a more soft and gentle tone, with less volume. Which quite disadvantageous for certain Autistic women who are unable to control their voice volume, thus may causing their voice occasionally sounds louder,

While I'm not old enough to remember that far back (I neither lived in Canada nor even lived at all in the 1980s), I know that our abortion laws were very restrictive. For those of you who don't live here and don't know, they were protested against by physicians who ignored them and kept going to court until the Supreme Court declared the laws unconstitutional, although they didn't thoroughly explain what kinds of abortion laws¬†*would*¬†be constitutional.

But since then there has been no serious attempt to pass any laws, which has left us in a situation where there are no laws at all, and all the rules and regulations (such as gestational time limits) are set by medical professionals without the government having any involvement whatsoever. I believe this same policy is shared by a handful of other countries including the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, as well as the most liberal US states, including Colorado, Washington, Oregon, New Hampshire, Vermont and Massachusetts (to my knowledge California is not on the list).

There is no explicit ""right"" to have an abortion in Canada. The law neither permits it nor prohibits it. It's simply legal by default because the government stays out of the issue. In other words, our laws neither grant nor deny the right to have an abortion. Just like the law doesn't explicitly grant the right to have your wisdom teeth removed, or to receive a kidney transplant, or to undergo any other medical procedure. Although there **is** a decent number of people in Canada who would like to pass¬†*some*¬†law (gestational time limits for example), there's practically no one who wants to make abortion illegal altogether. So there's simply no need to explicitly affirm a right that nobody is trying to take away.

And some recent referendums in deeply conservative states like Kansas and Kentucky have shown that the Republicans are mostly pro choice as well, just like our Conservative voters. Which I had suspected for quite some time, just by viewing opinion polls on both abortion and other issues such as gun control, universal healthcare, same sex marriage (although at this point even the Republican Party seems to have admitted that's a lost cause and moved on), cannabis, climate change, and many other issues that the United States is world famous for being behind in. In fact, I'll say if anything good came out of the RVW overturn, it was that it confirmed what I (and many others) had suspected all along, that the average Republican voter is nowhere near as far right or authoritarian as the Party itself. So that leads me to believe that such an approach could potentially work.

Should physicians in the United States protest against the recent overturn of Roe v Wade by simply ignoring restrictions? Because something tells me the jury won't allow those laws to be enforced.",1671818645.0,2022-12-23 18:04:05+00:00

108,How do I explain to someone that catcalling is bad?,212,zsaaht,Feminism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/zsaaht/how_do_i_explain_to_someone_that_catcalling_is_bad/,57,"I was having a conversation today with my father because he showed me a news article saying three men who were catcalling a woman in their company van got fired. He agreed that they should have gotten fired because they were continually harassing the woman, but he said if they just left it at a whistle they should have been fine, as that's just a compliment. I tried explaining to him why even a whistle is disrespectful, but I used the word dehumanizing and that's just a buzzword to him so he imeadietly shut down and buckled into his opinion further. I then went on to try to explain to my dad instances when catcalling has affected me (I specifically told him about my first instance of being whistled at was when I was in middle school, and I explained to him that it still happens to me at college even when I'm simply walking to class) He imeadietly waved me off as being too sensitive and if I'm going ti be honest I did get really emotional over the fact my own father was dismissing my experience with sexial harassment. 
Anyways, to the question. How am I even supposed to explain why all forms of catcalling is bad if the person on the other side of the conversation is heavily affected by buzzwords? Are there any other reasons that it could be bad besides the blatant misogyny and it being sexual harrasment? I just really don't know how to explain this without making the other person shut down or without getting too emotional.  
I'm honestly just so incredibly sick of having to explain this to people, even my own father. I feel like my experience with sexual harassment will never, ever be taken seriously no matter where I turn.",1671678251.0,2022-12-22 03:04:11+00:00

117,Observations of a farm girl.,520,zqqtze,Feminism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/zqqtze/observations_of_a_farm_girl/,95,"I am inundated with posts about incels and misogynist.  I read articles talking about how we are objects, how we have no value after being ‚Äúused up‚Äù from having more than one partner or how we are useless after we hit a certain age.  Everywhere I turn there seems to be someone talking about men being stronger and this primitive animalistic pecking order.

I am tired of it and wanted to point something out that constantly is at the forefront of my mind whenever I read shitty comments about us.

I own a farm, we have animals.  I don‚Äôt like killing animals and it makes me sad, but part of being a small farm is that you love your livestock but understand the circle of life.  In terms of keeping your population going, you keep the females and use the males for food.  You only need one male.

One male can mate with many females.  That is literally the only thing they are needed for.  They have literally no value beyond that.  Many farms won‚Äôt even have a male and will outsource semen from different bloodlines.  When birthing season comes around?  You cross your fingers for females.

As everyone here knows, all these ‚Äúwomen are useless‚Äù folks are out of touch with reality.  They want to talk about being providers and how the animal kingdom works, but they have no concept of what basic primitive animal husbandry or farming is.  They have no notion of how things work.  Show me how you are providing while I sit there sobbing after killing one of my animals for food.  Last I knew, playing video games and being an asshole isn‚Äôt providing anything.

With access to the internet, us women now have the ability to speak and coordinate better than ever before.  What we are seeing are men trying to desperately keep control through lies and manipulation.. it‚Äôs a fight they cannot win.

The next time you see someone posting about how superior and important men are, remember the farm and laugh.

(Obligatory, not all men. They aren‚Äôt useless.. at least, some of them!  Sadly, the smart ones aren‚Äôt the ones posting, it‚Äôs the ones out of touch with reality.)",1671548903.0,2022-12-20 15:08:23+00:00

**ENGLISH:**

‚ÄúA woman is a very expensive commodity in war‚Äù

In the report of the Secretary General of the UN Security Council of October 16, 2002 ""On Women, Peace and Security"", women and girls are singled out in a separate category as persons who, in situations of armed conflict, find themselves in a situation of ""increased vulnerability"".

In countries and republics where women are not represented or poorly represented in power, they do not have the opportunity to influence the decisions made by men. But they fully pay for them with their lives, as well as with constant fear, slavery and humiliation. Daptar talked (https:// daptar . ru/2022/03/15/dlya-zhenschinyi-svoih-na-voyne-net-iz-opyita-ochevidtsev/) with three respondents about the war and the women inside it.

Director Evdokia Moskvina argues: ‚ÄúIn war, all laws cease to work, all norms and boundaries collapse, it unties its hands. And a woman in war finds herself in a disproportionately more difficult situation than a man. She is vulnerable, she is not protected from either side. War reveals all base animal instincts and the woman becomes the victim in the first place. For her, there are no ‚Äúfriends‚Äù in the war.‚Äù

""War Starts at Home""

""War starts at home"", ""violence starts at home"" - these phrases were formulated as slogans (telegram . me/femagainstwar/2704) by the Korean cell of the Feminist Anti-War Resistance. What are they about?

About the cycle of militaristic, state and gender violence. There are studies that show a link between gender inequality and military aggression: countries that do not protect women from domestic and sexualized violence are more likely to unleash aggressive wars. A person who for many years with impunity raises his hand against loved ones in his own home, and a person who commits rape in a war and participates in the genocide of an entire nation - how often is this the same person? This is a question we must constantly ask ourselves and each other.

‚ÄúEverything starts at home,‚Äù says the partisan.press posters. We have covered the word ‚Äúeverything‚Äù with the now more total word ‚Äúwar‚Äù. Violence against loved ones, encouraged by the state, has spilled out beyond our state borders and acquired the most monstrous forms.

We are convinced that the timely adoption of a law on domestic violence would reduce the level of approval of violence and war in Russian society. Maybe that's why it was never accepted. We repeat once again that the rights of women and other vulnerable groups can no longer be put off until later. Because without these rights, ‚Äúlater‚Äù may never come.

I just joined this group. I am a 31 year old female living in Canada. I absolutely hate the state of society and the social conditioning and pressure women are put under. I've worked as a recruiter in Tech for the last 5 years in corporate underneath men that have called me emotional and talked to me like I was a child. That thought it was OK to gaslight me or talk to me whichever way they wanted because they were ""my boss"". The blatant disrespect I've endured in the workplace, in my personal life, and  in my family at the hands of men, while my mother always advised me not to address it or just let things be have left me traumatized as an adult.  I've been on antidepressants for years now. I need to just vent because for so long my mom would always say....boys will be boys... as if we should just accept the bad behaviour and give them a pass for being less evolved. 

I believe this blatant ignorance towards men and this saying is so dangerous to the point that it's enabled them to not develop as a human and allowed them to continually abuse systems because it's been deemed acceptable. 

I am truly hurting because I don't believe anyone around me gets it. I've been called negative many times for pointing out these realities in society, but I am always met with some sort of toxic positivity or a phrase that should overlook everything. Stuff like... ""you need to get over it.""

I am not over it. This is not okay. Constant abuse at the hands of men is not okay.",1670958706.0,2022-12-13 19:11:46+00:00

169,Why does it look like more feminine women are more submissive too with men?,0,zmeavm,Feminism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/zmeavm/why_does_it_look_like_more_feminine_women_are/,25,"I have noticed something that I find strange personally. 

I've noticed that most women who are ""femenine"" meaning, having long hair, wearing tight clothes, posing with their asses, or paying a lot of attention to their ass, and sexualizing themselves... I guess you know what I mean... 

You know what I mean when I say sexualizing yourself? Like a girl looks like she came out of a porn movie because of how she moves, etc. Like trying to always show her ass in every movement, having a ""vulnerable"" chest, or trying to show her chest... Having a posture like that...

Well what I've noticed is that women who act this way also have very ""delicate"" movements. Like, if you got them something to grab, they look like they couldn't even open a bottle of water. Their movements are extremely delicate, sensual, and weak?

So the weird thing about all this is that I personally find it very alien? As a woman, I see women like this and I don't feel identified at all. It feels like they're on they're sexual energy 24/7. Mostly girls you see on social media. It looks like some women are almost having sex because of the movements and poses they make or their attitude in general. Their whole persona looks like they're having sex and they're on their submissive mode 24/7. 

Kylie Jenner is a perfect example of this. She has a soft voice, she is very sexual, she speaks in a very monotone voice, her hands look like she has no strength at all. She doesn't use anything. Her whole behavior is like if she was being sexual all the time.

To be honest, I think this is designed for male gaze or at least it perfectly fits into the male gaze. Somehow women like this are usually part of a relationship too. I don't know if they become so femenine delicate and sexual once they have a partner. Or they were always like this, or what is it about them. 

Because for sure, I don't act like this. I don't act femenine nor masculine. I'm just normal. When I pose in pictures I can be beautiful or pretty but I never sexualize myself? Why not? Like, I don't understand why I'm not as femenine and sexual as these women? I don't feel like I'm delicate at all. I don't like that feeling because it makes me feel weak to be on that sexual energy all the time. 

I'm only that sexual when I'm having sex lmfao
So I really don't understand how women act like this, or at least on social media, they act so femenine. I really don't understand. Do they start acting like this to get men? Or they already got men and that's why they can be on that sexual delicate and femenine energy?

173,What counts as a ‚Äúnamed female character‚Äù?,3,zld3z5,Feminism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/zld3z5/what_counts_as_a_named_female_character/,4,"Earlier today, I was thinking about whether or not It‚Äôs Always Sunny in Philadelphia passes the Bechdel test. Ultimately I realized it does, but it brought up a question about whether or not ‚ÄúThe Waitress‚Äù is a named female character.

I think she is, because despite her actual name never being revealed in the series, she has a ‚Äúname‚Äù in a way, and while it‚Äôs a nickname or title, she‚Äôs still a named female character in the same way that a character referred to just as ‚ÄúThe Queen‚Äù or ‚ÄúMom‚Äù are.

I was discussing this with a friend, and he disagrees with me. He argues that those don‚Äôt count as names and in order for something to pass the test, the characters have to have actual names as in what you‚Äôd sign a legal paper with, and since The Waitress‚Äôs real name is never revealed, she doesn‚Äôt count.

However I always assumed that an ‚Äúunnamed‚Äù female character was a character not referred to as anything, who just has a single line or something. Like I was watching a movie a few days ago, and an old lady in a shop complimented a younger lady, the love interest of the movie, but I noted that that interaction didn‚Äôt pass the test because the old lady wasn‚Äôt important and didn‚Äôt have any sort of name.

In the credits of the movie, that old woman probably would‚Äôve been listed as ‚ÄúOld Woman‚Äù or something, which is a title, but that wouldn‚Äôt count as a name because she was never referred to that in the movie. Even if a character had called her ‚Äúan old woman‚Äù it still wouldn‚Äôt have counted.

However, The Waitress from IASIP is a different case, since she is a reoccurring character and I‚Äôm pretty sure even when the main characters talk to her they still call her ‚ÄúWaitress‚Äù even when she is no longer a waitress. There are other characters in IASIP like this as well, such as The Lawyer and The Waiter.

So please tell me your thoughts on this. Does a character with a title or nickname count as ‚Äúnamed‚Äù if their actual name is never revealed or said? Thanks!",1670980335.0,2022-12-14 01:12:15+00:00

I know about the existence of white feminism, swerf, and terf ideologies that are not intersectional, my point of view is about the double standards that there are in the political left, even the feminists have names (white feminist, swerf, and terf) when we are not intersectional, instead in leftism doesn't happen because I figure due to sexism, well leftism worldwide is dominated by straight cisgender men and neurotypical (I skip race because in many countries like mine is dominated by racialized men in POC countries, the countries with a majority white or with a huge quantity of white people are not unique important). I am from Peru, in my country rampant and flagrant sexism, misogyny, transphobia, queerphobia, racism, ableism, classism, and other oppressive things are normalized terribly, therefore, is necessary to focus not just on race and class analysis as leftists often do it, I understand that only race and class could affect to the majority of people, however, if we just analyze race and class, then we would create hierarchies on the basis of the oppressive things that only affect racialized -cis neurotypical -straight men without class privileges front to women and non-binary people/masculine trans people without privileges of sexual orientation, race, class, and neurotypical. Don't misunderstand me, I think that race and class analysis is so important within feminism for avoiding white feminism and neoliberal feminism (girl boss), my question is about the hypocrisy of many leftist men who quickly call white feminists or terf when they almost always are transphobic, homophobic, racist, and ableist, and only condemn them when the right wing is being oppressive or when terf is being transphobic, but when they are being oppressive none comrade say something.

A recent example is in the 4th episode of cabinets of curiosities where the first scene shows a woman's bare breast and her being drawn by the protagonist. The boob is completely nonessential to the plot. My argument here is WHY. Why show this woman's breast, there are plenty of other clothed poses one can do to show intimacy between artist and muse. To me this is a clear example of a director just wanting to take advantage of the female body's sexualization to get the viewers attention. It's lazy and disgusting.

Lately I've seen an uprise in videos where women start a fight, and then get hit back by a man. The comments are always flooded with jokes on the women and there's always a few ""Equal rights, equal lefts"" comments. I've been trying to figure out why these videos bother me so much, and I think I've figured it out.

Now, I think people should be held accountable for their actions. If you come off as aggressive against someone, don't be surprised if they react aggressive back, regardless of gender or size difference. I believe in that type of equality, but these videos are never or rarely fair. A very typical example might be a woman yelling at a man, maybe even slapping him, and he counters with a full swing punch to the skull that sends her on the ground unconscious. Should a man sit there and allow himself to get assaulted, in fear that any retaliation at all will paint him as the perpetrator by default? Absolutely not. If she slaps him first, should she expect a slap back? Yeah, I think so. If you get slapped, a slap back is completely fair and shouldn't be questioned, and certainly not based on gender. The thing is, in a vast majority of these videos, it's abundantly clear that the woman had no intention to do any real damage. 

They might yell, threaten, even throw a weak slap, but it's easy to tell when someone is intending to cause real physical damage (and therefore a genuine threat) versus simply being out of line. Men in these videos return a light slap across the cheek with a concussion - one she never saw coming not because you don't hit a woman, but because it's such an insane overreaction in that moment. Some other videos I've seen had the woman's back turned before receiving a sucker punch blow to the back of the skull. This is followed by hoots and hollers in the background of the video, and a stream of comments praising the man for not holding back. It's one thing if the level of aggression from the women is unclear and he's reacting in genuine defense, but most of these videos are clearly inspired by revenge. And the damage dealt is to an extent where it could be life-long damage, even death.

Again, many of these women are out of line (from the context supplied by the video anyway...) Violence is never the answer, and anyone who gets physical are opening themselves to physical retaliation. But it's disgusting how these videos are framed as gender battles, or used as examples for why women need to be afraid of men, created by men, for men's enjoyment.",1670715170.0,2022-12-10 23:32:50+00:00

[ Menstruation and human rights are inextricably linked. When we talk about human rights, we mean the rights every human being has from birth until death. These are the norms that aspire to protect all individuals from any kind of abuse. ](https://preview.redd.it/zs7llziv815a1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=13ab3c1604f19e3f7120362bee001f24fe8d885d)

 [**https://bit.ly/3W4pxZb**](https://bit.ly/3W4pxZb)**.** The presence of gender inequality, extreme poverty, humanitarian crises, and harmful traditions can all turn menstruation into a time of deprivation and stigma, which can undermine their enjoyment of fundamental human rights.

Menstruation is directly related to human dignity, as when people cannot access safe bathing facilities and safe and effective means of managing their menstrual hygiene, they cannot manage their menstruation with dignity.

There are various factors in how people are treated during menstruation worldwide.

* Few people believe that menstruation is dirty, and it is highly stigmatised.
* Secondly, there are barriers to sanitation and health as well.
* Poverty and other crises can limit women‚Äôs and girls‚Äô access to culturally appropriate, high-quality menstrual supplies and safe, private washing facilities.

There's a definite need for things that are required during menstruation.

* They must have safe access to clean material to absorb or collect menstrual blood.
* People who menstruate should also have access to health information and care.

Menstrual rights are often ridiculed. The pre-existing patriarchal system fails to understand the needs and necessities of menstruating people.

But why?? 
 
The decision to engage in sexual activity with others is highly personal and is influenced by a variety of social factors, including personal values, cultural beliefs, and self-esteem.

People have sex for a variety of reasons. Sometimes it's a conscious decision, and other times it just happens. It is natural and normal for most people to seek sex, especially when they are discovering their sexual identity. Some people, on the other hand, abstain due to religious or personal values.
 
Having sex is a choice - YOUR choice. Whether you wait or not, nobody can tell you what to do with your body, or when to do it. What should be important is being safe during sex, not when to have sex. 
 
When it comes to sexual antics, people lie, exaggerate, and can talk a good game. In the end, it makes no difference who is telling the truth. What is most important is what is best for you. That may sound corny, but it's true.
 
Let them judge you. 
Let them misunderstand you. 
Their opinions aren't your problem. 
You stay kind, committed to love, and free in your authenticity.
No matter what they do or say, don't you dare stop doing things that make you happy.
Just keep on shining like you do.

And I have even observed this bias coming from people giving relationship advice or general discussions on such subjects, like people are way less considerate or way more mean or ""just leave"" type with their opinions if it's a guy seeking advice for a relationship with a woman and I've also seen people mostly advising women to keep their boundaries strong etc etc to women partner seeking advice (but actually hinting towards telling her to give her guy a second chance)

Talking about the amateur mistakes made by professional journalists regarding such a delicate issue in the west is another topic, but they are getting to the point that some might think their agenda is more aligned with regime‚Äôs propaganda rather than what Iranian people are demanding, New York Times was calling it a **victory** which is honestly stupid.

The movement started after Jina Mahsa Amini died in morality police custody, but the morality police is only the tip of the iceberg. Islamic Republic laws are misogynistic, patriarchal and denies people and especially women and LGBTQ people basic human rights. People have been fighting shoulder to shoulder for the regime to be overthrown, and have been clear that the goal is the entire regime.  Before we had morality police, we had Islamic Revolution Committee, which was basically the morality police but harsher on both genders. I wasn‚Äôt born back then but many from older generations have the memories of Committee stoped them for wearing jeans, or short sleeves shirts, or boys and girls getting stopped, arrested and questioned about their relationships if they‚Äôve been seen in public together. Many haven‚Äôt heard of that in recent years, but that existed, and when it was gone, that didn‚Äôt mean that Hijab was free, or people could act, or wear as they like. Morality police simply does the same, but mainly targets women. Islamic Republic built their dictatorship on limiting women in every aspect of their lives, from marriage, permission to leave the country, custody of children, what to wear, permission to have a job, many other laws, all the time, some MAN have to permits them, or MAN have superiority to the woman by law. That‚Äôs half the population. Nothing shouts out more clearly that I defy you and hate your existence than a woman walking in the street without their compulsory hijab. For years by forcing the hijab, Islamic Republic was successful in convincing the world by selling an image that Hijab is within Iranian culture and what women actually want, and a minority don't beleive in that. Defying Hijab publicly, exposed their lies so clearly and this is why they would never take a step back from it, if they do then it‚Äôll be a domino ceasing them to exist.

Committee got replaced by morality police, and Iran stepped towards more limits on women by making them the main target this time. Now that more women are defying these rules everyday, Islamic Republic have to response, but unfortunately (for them obviously) this time there‚Äôs so many eyes on them, they can‚Äôt do so as public as before, so they‚Äôre taking a more silent approach. 

Any brave woman defying Hijab is getting more limited in their daily life. Two weeks ago, a bank manager was fired because a woman without Hijab received service at the branch, then a policy got published that bans businesses from providing service to women not wearing Hijab. Today, a video recording of an Iranian MP Hossein Djalali, came out saying that ""we should make women not wearing Hijab pay a higher price, Hijab is the flag of Islam and Islamic Republic, and if we step back it will fall"", parts of video he also says we (Parliment) are working on policies regarding that (more limits on women not wearing Hijab) together with judiciary system but he doesn't provide any details. This means if you‚Äôre a woman, and not wearing Hijab, you won‚Äôt have the same rights as the other women wearing it (We are talking about a country that women already don't have same rights as a man), and this is besides the fact they could prosecute you with many charges as they want. If you‚Äôre a woman athlete and you chose to publicly not wear the hijab, it‚Äôs more likely that you‚Äôll lose your position in the team (That‚Äôs why what Elnaz Rekabi did was huge and heroic). More and more female actors are getting summoned or arrested when they chose to go public without Hijab. And these are celebrities you would hear about, many woman in other positions and jobs, are losing their jobs because they defy these rules. That‚Äôs what Islamic Republic wants, making woman standing against them more isolated.

When you see headlines like that, please remember, Iranian women won‚Äôt be free unless Islamic Republic is gone, and day after day situation will get harder for them. Call it morality police, or whatever, it‚Äôll be only another packaging for the same or even worse thing.

Islamic Republic is way past reform, it simply can‚Äôt and have to fall. They will never take a step back from policies and values that are their foundation. No matter how they package it for media to consume, they‚Äôll never do that.",1670329441.0,2022-12-06 12:24:01+00:00

Unfortunately I didn't know the guy was some favorite among 4chan/8chan incel types. He reposted a picture of me from a few years ago and asked for people to comment. This was at nighttime and by the time i woke up there were dozens of comments (at least) talking about my body/face in super degrading ways - from sexualizing me to describing what they'd do to me to wondering where I lived, calling me ugly and various slurs. I privated my account, blocked everyone who commented and locked my DMs.

246,How I talk to my young children about abortion rights and women‚Äôs healthcare.,39,zci2xe,Feminism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/zci2xe/how_i_talk_to_my_young_children_about_abortion/,9,"Idk if this will be helpful to anyone but i feel like we‚Äôre working really hard to talk to our kids young about stuff like consent and bullying, talking about women‚Äôs rights is important to lay the foundation for at a young age too, imo. 

So I started w/ a simple object lesson when we‚Äôre casually in the kitchen, age 3-5 is fine. Take an egg out of the fridge. 

‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù

- it‚Äôs an egg.

‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs a chicken!‚Äù

- ha no, mommy! It‚Äôs an egg. 

‚ÄúOh. It‚Äôs not a chicken yet?‚Äù

- no, it‚Äôs an egg. 

Crack the egg open in a bowl. ‚ÄúIt hatched. Is it a chicken now?‚Äù

- no! It‚Äôs a egg still.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right! It‚Äôs just an egg. Not a chicken. It‚Äôs not a chicken because the hen didn‚Äôt sit on it and make it into a chick. The hen gets to choose. Did you know that girls also make eggs? They can turn into babies. And just like the hen, we get to chose if we want our egg to turn into a baby or not. Women get to choose.‚Äù

Then I reinforce it with other object lessons: art supplies aren‚Äôt a painting, we get to choose to turn it into one. Seeds aren‚Äôt trees; we get to choose to put them in the ground and grow them. These ingredients aren‚Äôt cake; we have to chose to make them into batter and bake it. We get to choose. 

Age it up as they grow and learn about sperm, it isn‚Äôt a baby, it‚Äôs a pre baby and only the person who is growing the pre baby can choose if they want to let it become a baby. By the time they‚Äôre actually dating, the idea should be so concrete that it‚Äôs second nature. 

I have 2 teens and one elementary aged kid and it seems to have worked well for the older ones and made talking about women‚Äôs health natural and predictable for them. The foundation that we get to choose what happens to our body is also critical with consent convos, so double value there. 

Hope this helps someone!",1670180114.0,2022-12-04 18:55:14+00:00

Every post is an image of one or multiple women all of middle eastern descent in heavy makeup with a black bar over them with an identifying number over her.

All of the post titles are the same spam in arabic which google translate changes to family names like so :

Every post title is like this or some variation. 

Every poster to the sub has no comment history outside of posting these images. The account that is sole moderator is also a mod of a similar sub with the random numbered name, but there is only 2 or so posts. It's simply strange and concerning.

I posted this last night to twoxchromosomes and they directed me to a report method but the report doesn't include the ability for me to detail WHY I am reporting it and I'm concerned that this will go under the radar as such.

Please, mods or those more fervent than me, take a look into it. 

**For the record this looks like a cryptic community like those youtube child porn abusers who used masked content to communicate and exploit the vulnerable.**

I can't not say something about it.

Nobody should be sold or treated like shit, and this looks really suspicious. To me at least. It's fuckin' weird.

My mind is consumed with facts like how one Australian woman, Nicola Stoker, was strangled by her ex who went to jail for this. He then violated his restraining order against her. Nicola tried to warn her ex's new partner of this, and the dick sued her.

AND WON.

Because he hadn't ""really tried to strangle"" her. Nicola was being *dramatic,* the judge thought. He was just clearly trying to silence her. Jennifer Robinson heard this and was was like 'No, wait, *seriously?'* so she *appealed it* and the new judge was like ""no the first judge is right Nicola's being dramatic she's not dead"". (Almost ten years later, a third appeal was successful, but the answer will live a bitter taste in your mouth.)

Anyway, I can't stop thinking about it. I am so angry about it. I'm furious. Why does the world hate us so much? Why does the *law* hate us so much? Why is it is so perfectly designed to protect men? Not just the rich and powerful ones ... all of them?

253,My (22F) father (50M) is a serial womanizer who serially manipulates women.,20,zbvb3i,Feminism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/zbvb3i/my_22f_father_50m_is_a_serial_womanizer_who/,7,"In 7-8 months, my (22F) biological father (50M) will have **5 children**: 3 with his ex-wife, 1 (me) with a one-night stand he never saw again, and 1 with his 25-year-old fiancee. My mom did not know who my father was until last year, when I took an AncestoryDNA test and tracked my biological father down. She straightened out when she got pregnant and did her very best to raise me right.

I've spoken to him multiple times since we met earlier this year, and I've discovered two things: he's **broke as heck** and he is a **serial womanizer**. He's middle-aged but still spends *thousands* of dollars per month on OnlyFans, at strip clubs, with escorts. All this while having to pay alimony and child support for 2 of his 3 legitimate kids, which he is (surprise surprise!) behind on.

Recently my dad told me that he's getting **married again**, to a 25-year-old who's pregnant with his child. I thought this was really weird. He's slept with (likely) hundreds of women, even while married, none of whom he was even *remotely* interested in committing to. I also wondered why he wasn't pressuring this woman to abort her child. He sure as heck can't afford another kid.

After talking to his ex-wife and doing some online research, I think I've cracked my dad's code. There *is* a method to his baby daddy madness.

His first wife, the ex with 3 kids, came from a relatively **wealthy family**. She inherited a decent chunk of the family estate. She also had a major drinking problem and wasn't financially literate *at all*, which I'm certain that my dad encouraged. Over 20+ years of marriage, he squandered every last dime of her money. By the time they divorced, there were basically no assets to split.

At first, I thought his fiancee was a desperate mail-order/green-card bride. Turns out she comes from a **well-off family** as well; her father owns some businesses along the West Coast and likely earns six figures per year. I'm 99.99% certain that my dad *deliberately* knocked her up so that he could marry her to ""preserve her honor"" (she's from an Asian family), then mooch off of her family's money.

Holy s\*it. The way my sperm donor treats his supposedly well-off wives . . . I'm so glad that my mom never tried tracking him down during my childhood, no matter how hard it was to make ends meet. It's one thing for me to have learned about this at 21, when I had the education and mental capacity to think critically about the situation, but to have witnessed his lifestyle as a child . . .

Men will *never* run out of ways to manipulate women. **It's up to us to stay one step ahead.** As a lifelong feminist, I believe it's our obligation to *educate ourselves* about people like my dad, not just assume that because they're charming and say ""all the right things"" they don't have ulterior motives.",1670113251.0,2022-12-04 00:20:51+00:00

Online harassment is nothing new, but it is certainly getting worse. With Elon Musk buying Twitter and the rapid rise of misogyny and harassment that has come with it I am seriously scared for the impact it will have on women seeking political office (or being political at all). There are two things we can't underestimate: 

1. the important role Twitter plays in political women being able to spread their message and garner support (look to Iranian women, AOC, etc). I'm going to lose my s\*\*\* if another man tells me to just delete Twitter as if somehow it is fair that men will have access to this massive political tool and we women will just exile ourselves. 
2. online harassment is TRAUMATIC. I think we too often consider online harassment as the lowest form of misogynistic rhetoric and couldn't be further from the truth. I would never tell the candidates I work with even a quarter of the hateful garbage we are sent on a daily basis. Just last week I intercepted a dick pic sent to one of our accounts and I had to take three days off the campaign because I felt so sick and disturbed. That's three days not out door knocking or making calls. Do our male opponents face harassment? Sure. Politics is toxic. But certainly not to the degree we women experience. I have had to work with women candidates to set up thousands of dollars of security equipment, donor money spent in ways that men would be spending on literature and ads.

I'm 32M, musician, and I am very disturbed by the idea that a lot of (male) musicians engage in sexual relationships with their (female) fans.

Dignity thus means affordable access and shameless access to every sanitation product ever required. Period dignity is the result of period equity and the solution to period poverty. 

The four pillars of period dignity are:-

* **Dignity is about Access** 

Half of the population still does not have access to basic period products so it is extremely important to make these products available at a very affordable price so that everyone can have access to it

* **Dignity is about respect**

Educating everyone about periods openly and honestly means understanding the needs of those who menstruate without belittling or de-legitimizing their experiences. Allowing privacy or support when needed or providing a safe space where discussions around periods can happen without fear of judgement are all ways of demonstrating respect and period dignity.

* **Dignity is about education**

Taboo topics become less taboo when they are discussed more. Basic education will help to remove the stigmas still existing in our society. 

* Lastly, **period dignity is all about sustainability**

Reusables, plastic-free, compostable, chlorine-free, and organic options must be considered a priority when providing for people with limited access to period products.

Part of me wants to cave and start using the god damn exclamation points just to protect my position, but the feminist in me wants to release frogs in his office before I change who I AM to fit HIS expectation of how I should act. 

Sending good vibes to all. Rise of the divine feminine.


UPDATE: I have read all of the amazing advice and cannot express how thankful I am for all of y‚Äôall. I was feeling nervous about coming back this AM, but will all of your help I put on my red pumps (which I was told previously was not an appropriate business professional color) and decided to keep kicking ass, just as I was.

Canada is the same with the number of options and types of IUDs available. 

I wish I could get the GyneFix here - a type of frameless non-hormonal IUD that is small, long lasting, and doesn't have the risk of perforation, but it's not available. It's been available to women Europe and Asia for years, and has been tested since the 1990's. It's ridiculous that such a simple and effective method of non-hormonal birth control has been denied to women here. The vast array of consumer choices seemingly offered by North American capitalism has failed millions of women - where we have little to no choice when it comes to our bodies and basic healthcare that can have significant impact on our lives.

The rail industry is heavily male-dominated. 95% is the stat I was able to find. 

There is no such thing as backup care for sick kids. That‚Äôs a myth perpetuated by employers. Some people may have some assistance from family who are available and healthy enough to care for a sick child‚Äîmost families don‚Äôt. 

What is left unsaid is the assumption that these workers have someone at home to care for their family. (Read: a wife)

It‚Äôs awful for men and women to have to work with no short term paid sick time, but in addition, the wives, girlfriends, husbands and partners of these workers will pay the price for the lack of sick days. The burden of childcare will fall on them. 

My husband works in manufacturing and has a similar policy: no sick time, just a few personal days and if he takes them, he gets a ‚Äúpoint‚Äù which lowers his annual review score and subsequently, his annual pay increase and after six points he‚Äôs fired. He is completely willing to help with sick kids, but his ability to do so is very restricted. I have had to stay in lower-paying flexible jobs longer than I wanted to because of his work policies. 

In real time we‚Äôre watching the perpetuation of the cultural notion that there‚Äôs a wife at home taking care of the kids and household. 

The acknowledgment that people need enough time off work to participate in the daily lives and needs of their families is a labor issue, a human rights issue, a class issue and a feminist issue.

289,Sexual Predators Flourish in a Carefully Crafted Field of Silence,84,z7zpcn,Feminism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/z7zpcn/sexual_predators_flourish_in_a_carefully_crafted/,2,"## Nondisclosure Agreements

How is silence carefully crafted? Based on the relentless advocacy by targets of predatory harassment as well as films such as [\#SheSaid](https://www.debbiedougherty.com/blog/hashtags/SheSaid), it is clear that **nondisclosure agreements** are one way in which silence is carefully crafted. 

I recently had the opportunity to watch Gretchen Carlson, previously a top Fox News broadcast talent, and a cofounder of the nonprofit organization [Lift Our Voices](https://www.liftourvoices.org/about), speak about the silencing power of nondisclosure agreements. I was blown away by Carlson‚Äôs dynamic presentation, her personal presence, her vocal intensity. There is a reason why she was a top broadcast news talent. She earned her way into that space with her ability and effort. Yet, she faced persistent and severe [sexual harassment](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/07/business/media/gretchen-carlson-fox-news-roger-ailes-sexual-harassment-lawsuit.html) while at Fox News. There are even television [dramas](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6821044/) and [documentaries](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8558952/) about her experience. Don‚Äôt you think it is weird that due to her nondisclosure agreement with Fox News, Carlson is not legally allowed to tell her own story? She can‚Äôt tell us if the dramatizations got it right. She can‚Äôt even talk about the stipulations in the nondisclosure agreement. 

As was made clear in the movie [\#SheSaid](https://www.debbiedougherty.com/blog/hashtags/SheSaid), nondisclosure agreements are not just about individual targets. Their very existence sucks the oxygen from the room, allowing the predatory behavior to continue unabated. Although these agreements are the most recognized form of silence, they are a post harassment form of silencing. Long before a nondisclosure agreement is signed, targets of predatory sexual behavior face silencing that occurs prior to, during, and after the predator acts. 

## Mystification

Perhaps the most powerful form of organizationally crafted silence is mystification. Mystification is kind of like [\#gaslighting](https://www.debbiedougherty.com/blog/hashtags/gaslighting), but on a grand scale. Instead of a single individual making another individual doubt their reality, the organizational culture as a whole works to make the target of predatory sexual behavior doubt their experience. Someday I will do an entire blog post on mystification, but for now, I will walk you through an example. 

Megan (a pseudonym) was sexually assaulted in her private office by a colleague/predator. While physically hurting Megan, the predator talked about how much he cared about her, how he could help her with her career, how much she will enjoy their sexual encounter. Although she keeps saying ‚Äúno,‚Äù the colleague predator pulls back for a moment then reengages, as if Megan's ‚Äúno‚Äù is only a momentary ‚Äúno.‚Äù Eventually he leaves her office and Megan wonders why she let him do this stuff to her. Of course, she did not let him do it. He assaulted her without her consent. But you see, his words contradicted his behavior. His behavior was non-consensual, but his words sounded like this was a mutually consensual encounter. It sounded like *He* was doing *He*r a favor.  The predator's behavior is classic gaslighting. It is what happens next where gaslighting becomes mystification. 

The mystification continues when Megan tells a colleague/friend about the assault. The colleague looks puzzled by Megan‚Äôs account of the story. The colleague/friend tells Megan she was unprofessional when she let the predator close her office door. Everyone knows the colleague/predator will push the situation as far as he is allowed. Next time, keep the door open and brush him off (Next time? But yes, this happens). 

The mystification scales up when Megan reports the behavior to her supervisor, she is asked if she really wants to pursue this issue. After all, she could destroy the predator‚Äôs career over an event that was most likely a misunderstanding. 

The mystification diffuses through the organizational culture when Megan mentions the event to her close colleagues. They look embarrassed and try to remind her that the predator is really a good guy with a family. He is just socially awkward. You see, Megan violated unspoken cultural norms that you don‚Äôt talk bad about other colleagues, even when the colleague is a sexual predator. 

Megan knows she was hurt, but as a result of the relentless organizational response, she begins to question her version of reality. 

*She thinks maybe she is the problem.*

*She thinks maybe she could have stopped the assault.* 

*She thinks maybe she is weak.* 

*She thinks maybe she is the bad guy.* 

Megan does not pursue the harassment claim, soon leaves the organization, and suffers from ongoing anxiety due to the assault. This is the most common outcome of predatory sexual harassment. **Mystification not only makes a person doubt their own reality, but creates an organizational culture where others doubt the targets experience as well**.

## Taking Action

What are our action steps? Well, first, it should be illegal for nondisclosure agreements that obscure or hide illegal behavior by an organization‚Äîregardless of what that illegal behavior may be. Predatory sexual harassment includes sexual assault, pedophilia, rape, quid pro quo demands, and hostile environments. Hiding this behavior through nondisclosure agreements allows sexual predators to continue to engage in illegal, hurtful, and destructive behavior. Based on the work by [\#LiftOurVoices](https://www.debbiedougherty.com/blog/hashtags/LiftOurVoices) and by other advocates, the United States passed the [\#Speakoutact](https://www.debbiedougherty.com/blog/hashtags/Speakoutact), [which limits the enforcement of nondisclosure agreements](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/congress-passes-law-banning-non-disclosure-agreements-in-sexual-harassment-cases) in sexual harassment and abuse cases.That is good news. But **what about mystification?** What do we do to stop this nonsensical behavior. The answer is complicated, but I would suggest we start by taking the target seriously and to stop worrying so much about the predator‚Äôs career and family. Instead, we need to focus on the organization and worker well being. That means, sometimes, making the hard call by recognizing predatory sexual behavior for what it is, and by removing these people from the organization.",1669741698.0,2022-11-29 17:08:18+00:00

I'm a kpop fan and I've noticed an overwhelming amount of men who just blatantly and mindlessly hate on it. They say such misogynistic, homophobic, and sometimes racist things that aren't even true. You've probably heard of false claims that can easily be debunked like ""they're all crazy 12 year old fangirls"" or ""all kpop idols look gay and feminine"" and stuff like that. But at the same time, no one even mentions all the horrible male fans of female idols that act so much worse. Sports fans are allowed to go crazy and scream at an event, but apparently screaming at a concert is weird? 

It's like teenage girls aren't allowed to go through phases and act like a teenager, while boys are allowed to. So many of these people just dismiss kpop as ""trash"" without even listening to the music and how it has many different genres. The prejudice and hypocrisy is so strong. As an anime fan, I see similar things happening as well. You all probably know how problematic and awful anime fans and anime itself can be, just like how Japan has a big pedophilia problem. But somehow it's ok for men to be attracted to underage anime girls but it's suddenly cringe for women to like anime boys. Most of the women who like these things aren't even toxic and just normal people but they use it as an excuse to hate on all women who like them. 

I recently came across such misogynistic comments on a YouTube video attacking women who like kpop that are too horrible to even share here. I've even gotten bullied in middle and high school for simply liking these things. There are a lot of other interests women like that get villified as well.

In her soul-lifting poetry and songs, she speaks of a personal relationship with Lord Krishna as her lover, Lord, and her inspiration. The underlying theme of her every poetic piece is complete spiritual surrender, as is evident from one of her creations below,

>‚ÄúAfter making me fall for you so hard, where are you going?  
>  
>Until the day I see you, no repose: my life, like a fish washed on shore, flails in agony.  
>  
>For your sake I‚Äôll make myself a yogini, I‚Äôll hurl myself to death on the saw of Kashi.  
>  
>Mira‚Äôs Lord is the clever Mountain Lifter, and I am his, a slave to his lotus feet.‚Äù

Mirabai lived an exemplary holy life, standing against the conventions of her times to become one of the greatest female saints of India who is still revered across the world for her magical devotional poems and songs.

Meera Bai created more than 1300 prayer songs which are called ""bhajans,"" which are still sung today across the world. She is also popularly called the incarnation of Radha, the Hindu deity.

I was going braless and have a crop top on with a split in front, it's fixed on the sides with hooks, so you can only see cleavage and guess the shape of my breast.

This is not something you wear to work or to a family gathering and I wasn't going to.
My mom called me slutty and disrespectful....I asked her if she would say the same to a man going shirtless in summer, she said it was different because they don't have boobs and that I don't need to be surprised when a man rapes me...since it entices them unlike when a woman sees a shirtless man...
I'm speechless.
It's not my fault if other people can't control their behavior nor do I think blaming a victim for their appearance is correct and I'm not showing everything, no nipples and most of my boobs are covered too.
I think it's unfair that we are inherently taught to mind our looks, not dress slutty or even in what we're comfortable in.

I seeked dates because I thought that men's validation was what indicated my attractiveness. I thought if a guy liked me, ***THAT*** was proof I was pretty. I think this was because I, and many girls from a young age, was often told to look outward for what to do. I was taught to be a ""people pleaser"" and taught that if others didn't value me, I had no value. When it came to sexual appeal, the same rule followed in my mind.

I've been growing out of this these past 6 months. I had an ""eh"" experience with dating last summer and took a small break. I put more time into myself and my friends instead of men. From this, I had my revelation. I hooked up for my ego, not for me. Tbh, my self esteem post-dating is better overall than before. Because I'm not looking to anyone else. I validate my own looks & personality. 

At first I felt... uncomfortable... that I allowed men to have control over my self-perception, but then I realized... we all have modes gaining self esteem in some form or another. It's okay that I felt that way, and it's wonderful I learned a lesson from it.

I'm not beautiful because some guy wants to take me to dinner. I'm beautiful because I have internal value. It's all within me- in my soul. 

Anyways, was curious if anyone gets what I'm saying? If not, that's ok. We all have different experiences with dating and self esteem. Have a great night <3",1669422836.0,2022-11-26 00:33:56+00:00

A friend of mine has a small business and I use her services exclusively.

Today she posted a status from Andrew Tate, denying the existence of depression. This isn't the 1st time I have seen similar posts on her feed. This is definitely the worst.

She promotes a lot of that toxic positivity and internalized misogyny.

I have pointed out to her how this is harmful and that my lived experience with mental health challenges is real and debilitating, and millions of people are suffering.

Our country has a very ignorant view of women in society, mental health, and LGBTQIA+ rights.

I want to end the friendship but in a way that gives her something to think about.

TLDR: How to end a friendship in a powerful way, after seeing them repeatedly post denying mental health and promoting misogyny?

when a man sees a woman wearing a radiohead shirt and his first instinct is to doubt that she listens to them: it's because accepting that she stays up far too late crying to pyramid song would mean acknowledging her existence as human.

there is no fundamental reason why women can't listen to moody atmospheric music with complexity to its sound, to play video games, to watch anime or taxi driver. the refusal to recognize that women participate in these activities is because men don't think women exist outside the strict parameters of feminine behavior, all lot of which centers around the perceived desire to attract men (regardless of wether thats actually her intention). for example, why don't men question women if they say they like doing their makeup, getting their nails done, and shopping? because that implies she's spending most of her waking hours trying to look attractive to people assumed to be men. 

despite men not doubting a woman's ability to hyper focus on her physical appearance; they don't respect her regardless. these woman are so often sneered and gawked at for their percieved superficiality. for women who have hobbies outside of these aforementioned parameters they have the chance of being seen as different from these ""fake bimbos"" but that shred of humanity hinges on vitriol for ""other girls"". to me it's only natural that there are woman attempting to toe the line of being both attractive and unique. these women have been coined the ""pick me girls"". even in their desperate attempts to be afforded respect and humanity they are mocked and belittled.

Since so few SA's get reported because police inaction is so additionally traumatizing and even fewer get any police action, I thought maybe we could put our heads together and find out why the police aren't helping, or rather how to get then to act. (Because we know why, really.)

378,Keeping a relationship with an agressor,15,yyrad6,Feminism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/yyrad6/keeping_a_relationship_with_an_agressor/,5,"Lately I¬¥ve been thinking a lot about women¬¥s expected reaction towards a situation of abuse. And I don¬¥t mean directly the victim, but other women surronding the situation, specifically those related in any kind of way to the agressor. 

I believe we are typically expected to cut all form relationship with the agressor, or at least that is the way I¬¥ve experienced it, this on behalf of sorority. And I get it, however I do believe there are many facets to the same person, and sometimes people can live parallel lives, which leads to completley different perceptions of them.  

Please understand I am not talking about covering up for them, or excusing what they have done, not even the consequences it should have, which there must definitley be and we should never make it easier on them. I am only talking about the relationship you have with the person. 

Unfortunatley I¬¥ve been on both sides, I have been victim of a family member and I remember being so mad at other women in my family for keeping the relationship ‚Äúintact‚Äù with him, and it was also very hard for me to see other female family members ,who didn¬¥t know about what happened, remembering him so fondly after he passed. I remember wanting to tell them that he was not the person they thought he was. It took time and a lot of working on myself, to realice they didn¬¥t owe me anything, not even those who knew, and it was also interesting realizing I never had those same feelings towards male members of the family.  

They didn¬¥t owe me anything because fortunatley they had known a very different side of him, and it wasn¬¥t fair of me to expect them to change their relationship with him. Their internal conflict about what happened and how they handled it, I will never known and I don¬¥t have any say on that. In this case it didn¬¥t have any consequences it was kept as a ‚Äùfamily secret‚Äù, which I believe is the only thing that made them accomplices, they owed me justice but not stopping or changint the relationship they kept with him.  

I realized this after I found out a lot of things about another family member, about what he had done to his wife in the past, through the years he had a radical change. The man I met, or at least the one I saw, was completly different. I knew him all my life and I never would have imagined he would be capable of doing such things. After he passed I felt so guilty about grieving his dead, when he had donde so many things that go against all of my core beliefs, when he had hurt a woman the same way someone else had hurt me. Then I realized I didn¬¥t have to take responsability for any of his actions, that my feelings for him were valid, never excusing what he did, nor invalidating his wife¬¥s experience, but I didn¬¥t have to stain my memories with him, with the memories of someone else. Keep in mind I am not even sure his wife was aware of all the abuse she went through, back in her day it was way much more normalized tan it is today, had she wanted to take any action against him, which I whish she had, I would have completley supported her. 

Women are always the ones pressured and expected to react a certain type of way. Wether they are the victim they are always questioned about why they didn¬¥t do anything to stop it, if they keep a relationship with the agressor they are called out for their lack of sorority, if they have been somehow involved ( I mean this like in cheating) they are the ones who carry all the guilt. Let¬¥s take off the pressure of women and call out the true and only responsable THE AGRESSOR. 

If you are the one questioning your feminism over a situation of abuse involving someone you have any sort of relationship with, I hope you understand you are not at all responsible of what happend, and whatever relationship you choose to have with the agressor is valid and completley personal. If you are the victim, first of all I am so sorry you had to experience that and from the bottom of my hear I hope you can heal from it, all of your feelings are valid just please do not misdirect them to those who had nothing to do with it. 

I hope I could convey my message, it was very hard to find the words because I think there is a very thin line between keeping a relationship and becoming an accomplice. You can choose your relationship with whomever, but NEVER be an accomplice, NEVER keep silent, NEVER condone or undermine what they have done.",1668796877.0,2022-11-18 18:41:17+00:00
379,Underlying misogyny?,156,yy7i7w,Feminism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/yy7i7w/underlying_misogyny/,54,"I just watched a tiktok that had this text ‚ÄúMy toxic trait is that I am liberal like extremely blue however I love a republican man. I think jokes about women being objects are funny, I‚Äôm ok never having to drive, I enjoy drinking beer and watching sports, they are emotionally unintelligent which is a bit annoying but a man crying gives me the ick so it‚Äôs okay I guess.‚Äù 

There were MANY comments agreeing with the tiktok and I was a bit heart broken. I think the never having to drive, drinking beer and watching sports is fine, no problem with that. But I have a working theory that a lot of ‚Äúicks‚Äù are just underlying misogyny and it‚Äôs also what causes women to be attracted to republican leaning men. Since republican men often are hyper masculine or try very hard to avoid being feminine in any way they are often considered more attractive.* Nothing wrong with finding masculinity attractive, but I think finding feminity unattractive in men IS a problem. You don‚Äôt like when men cry because it‚Äôs feminine‚Ä¶ or at least that‚Äôs what I think the underlying reason is. I think this also HEAVILY applies to the ‚Äúnice men finish last‚Äù idea. Which is a WHOLE other thing to unpack and not my point but it‚Äôs definitely connected. Idk. What do you think? Is that tiktok totally internalized misogyny or not? I think saying something is an ick is such a cop out. 

I also would hate for this to be seen as me trying to police women, I think we deal with ENOUGH and shouldn‚Äôt be worried about trying to protect men but it‚Äôs important to recognize our internal misogyny in order to empower other women and move on as movement.

*I may have conflated republican and gender conforming men in my original post. I don‚Äôt think all republicans men are hyper masculine but I think that is the main point that the tiktok maker was getting to whether she realizes it or not - she wants a man who confirms to his gender roles and isn‚Äôt feminine.

382,I'm tired of the oversexualization and fetishism of women,482,yxp33r,Feminism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/yxp33r/im_tired_of_the_oversexualization_and_fetishism/,57,"As a young woman, I'm just sick and tired of how women are oversexualized and fetishized. Such as how women are portrayed in fictional media, the beauty standards and expectations, and even how most rape victims are women. How so many women's clothing are designed to be more revealing, uncomfortable, and flamboyant. How there's a Victoria's Secret but no ""Victor's Secret"". How capitalism profits off of women's bodies by treating them as commodities and products for making money. That's why so many media like in anime and video games have terrible portrayals of female characters that were just made for the male gaze. There's a reason why subs like r/nothowgirlswork and [r/badwomensanatomy](https://www.reddit.com/r/badwomensanatomy/) exist. Movements like ""free the nipple"" and the body hair debate sadly have to exist to try and fight against double standards.

There's a reason why so many women are sexually frustrated as well. Many men don't know or care enough to know how to pleasure women in bed. (This issue mainly happens with straight men and women though). Plus, porn is like 95% male gaze and not very female friendly. Women are ridiculed for things like being horny but men aren't, and our sexuality isn't encouraged unless it benefits the male gaze (hence the fetishism of bi women and lesbians). It's sad how women get slut shamed for things society wouldn't slut shame men for as well. 

Women's bodies are also seen as taboo and impure. As a spiritual/religious woman, there's a reason why I left the church. We're pressured to fit these certain standards of beauty and how to act that it's just exhausting. This all stems from patriarchal views and misogyny that puts so much value on women's looks. We're still a long way from ever achieving ""equality"" in stopping women from being the hyper sexualized, objectified, and fetishized sex. Femininity itself is so sexualized too. There's nothing wrong with women choosing to be sexy of course if it's their choice and not forced, but it goes a lot deeper on why most men wouldn't act the same way and sexualize themselves, especially if they identify as straight, which also relates to toxic masculinity. 

It just disappoints me how when I try to complain about this, people don't seem to care and just shut me down for being dramatic and a ""crazy feminist"". I'm obviously not blaming ""all men"" for this but just the patriarchy and society in general. This issue is a lot more harmful than it sounds and I'm just hoping to find people who understand unlike many other subs.",1668688356.0,2022-11-17 12:32:36+00:00

I know he is banned from social media, but the name still pops up absolutely everywhere in tiktok algorithms for example, and is constantly being pushed on people, little kids especially. What is wrong with this world. Thankfully, my little brothers teacher told them that Tate is a very bad man and how he is not someone who should be admired and he told them about the bad stuff and things Tate has done. The teaches is a cool type of man, so they listened thankfully I think, sadly if he were a woman they probably would not have even listened at all. But the internet is being used as such a weapon against women. With extreme porn being so normalised these days and kids having access to it, enforcing horrible gender roles and abuse, and now crap like Jordan Peterson and Andrew Tate is being pushed on impressionable minds as well. I just don't know what to do, is there any hope for this world? It makes me so angry that a grown man is hurting little girls all over the world like this. I can‚Äôt imagine the harm being done to little girls in elementary school right now as they have to listen to this stuff, right when their sense of self is being formed.

Reasons to be modest include:

\--- She needs to cover up to be respected... This is slut shaming. 

\--- She needs to cover up so men won't harass her... This is victim blaming. 

\--- She needs to cover up because she's insecure about her body... This stems from unrealistic beauty standards.

\--- She needs to cover up because her religion says so... This stems from religion historically being misogynistic and controlling women through bodily oppression.

I think there may be a pattern and I would love to talk about this experience. 

In his opinion I am ruining my life by allowing myself to feel angry, hurt, disappointing by the world, angry. 

In his opinion I am too soft to do any good for the world and I need to harden up if I want to help people. In his opinion I just ignore my pain and drink beer or wine and not cry about it. In his opinion I am crazy and need to get it together. 

In his opinion I feel too much. I don't. I love this world and I deeply care about the well being of the people around me and I don't want to accept the status quo, but make it a little bit better. 

The topic of the conversation was me worrying about a friend who is deep down in a depression. He said I should just not get involved, even blamed the friend for his depression... The conversation went on and on and I felt so emotionally invalidated I couldn't take it anymore. I have had this type of conversation with so many different people, it is just frustrating. 

And I don't believe it to be true at all. We have all the right to feel.

What started with demonstrations over the killing of Mahsa Amini, over an alleged improper observance of the Islamic dress code, has now grown to calls for a revolution. Women as the primary victims of Islamism have been at the forefront of this movement since the beginning. But the cries of ‚ÄúWe will fight, we will die, but we‚Äôll take Iran back‚Äù and ‚ÄúThis year is the year of blood, and Khamenei will be overthrown‚Äù can be heard across over 100 cities and all provinces of Iran, by all people old and young, male and female, poor and wealthy. The Iranian people are tired of 43 years of oppression and want regime change. This revolution, if successful, will be a major turning point for women‚Äôs rights across the region, and the world in general.

So the question you may be asking yourself is ‚Äúwhy should I care?‚Äù Why should we care about a third-world country 7000 miles away? Well, I can appeal to your sense of empathy, and say that 15,000 lives are at stake, and that the Iranian women deserve their freedom. But I‚Äôm not going to do that. My point is that this issue affects **you** directly. 

As Noam Chomskey said in 1994:

>\[The US is\] a very fundamentalist society. It‚Äôs like Iran in the degree of fanatic religious commitment. You get extremely strange results. For example, I think about seventy-five percent of the population has a literal belief in the devil. There was a poll several years ago on evolution. People were asked their opinion on various theories of evolution, of how the world came to be what it is. The number of people who believed in Darwinian evolution was less than ten percent. About half the population believed in a church doctrine of divine-guided evolution. Most of the rest presumably believed that the world was created a couple of thousand years ago. This runs across the board. These are very unusual results. Why the U.S. should be off the spectrum on these issues has been discussed and debated for some time.

We are living in an era where democratic backsliding is a very real threat to democracies across the globe. The January 6 insurrection showed that a populist strongman has the capability to rock the foundations of democratic institutions. Roe v Wade being overturned just this year, shows that secularism can be encroached upon by religious institutions, and women‚Äôs rights can be eroded this way.

Iran was not always a hellscape for women‚Äôs rights. Back in the 70s there were women judges, ministers, and many other professionals working in important positions. We‚Äôve all seen those pictures on Reddit of ‚ÄúIran before the Islamic Revolution.‚Äù Religious takeover of Iran caused many of those accomplishments to be rolled back.

The struggle of Iranian women is closer than you think, if the Iranian women are successful, it will absolutely legitimize the struggle of American women as well. It‚Äôs time that the world shows that fundamental issues such as democracy, secularism, and women‚Äôs rights are worth preserving. On the other hand, if Iranians manage to remove the yoke of patriarchal oppression, it will undermine the alt-right‚Äôs chances of dismantling the rights of their citizens also.

# What can you do to help? 

**You can tell your government to recognize the struggle of the Iranian people. The French president Emanuel Macron recently recognized the protests as a ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù, but Biden‚Äôs administration has failed to do so. Especially if you are an American, you can pressure your congressperson to recognize what‚Äôs happening in Iran as a revolution. This simple act may take you 30 minutes at most, but such an approval of their movement, can make all the difference. Freedom is not free and future generations of women are looking to you to protect their freedom.**

414,Midterms and Voting Demographics / The Psychology of the Republican White Woman,10,yut0wz,Feminism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/yut0wz/midterms_and_voting_demographics_the_psychology/,5,"I've seen a lot of commentary and voting demographics in a couple of states that show white women voting predominantly Republican and I wanted to respond to it here and see what you all think of it. DISCLAIMER FOR THE WHOLE POST: I am not justifying or excusing white women voting Republican nor am I framing racism by white women as something where the white woman is the victim, I'll probably say this a lot of times but I want to make it clear where I stand.

I've seen a lot of things like this but I saw a tweet to the effect of ""if white women think they're oppressed they should start voting like they are"" and it kinda pissed me off. The sentiment is correct of course (white women shouldn't align themselves with the politics of the oppressor), but I think it's super tone deaf. To argue that white women participating in racist politics means they are equal to white men on the social hierarchy is... completely ignorant to why white women vote Republican IMO. And it literally just proves how deeply misogynistic society is.

The world is so deeply misogynistic, every level of society and every political party or ideology, that EVERYONE (men, women, everyone of any race) take it as a given that women will always be subordinate to men. We will always be commodities to be bought, whether that's with the engagement ring or subscription to our OnlyFans. We will always be the property of a man. Our social status and worth will always depend on what men we associate with, what men accept us, what men own us. So we attempt to make ourselves more expensive, more treasured, more valuable. This comes in the form of beauty -- we wear the most makeup, get plastic surgery, etc. Since Western beauty standards are structured around white supremacy, white women will always have the one-up here. Though perfect beauty is unattainable, the ideal type of the perfect woman is a white woman (in the West, at least). This is evidenced through the popularity of rhinoplasties that change ethnic noses into the stereotypical white girl's button nose, or the ways women of color are framed as violent and non-feminine, or the way blonde hair (the whitest hair color of them all) is widely considered the most privileged and ""pretty"" hair color.

I kind of got off on a tangent there, so back to the original point. Basically, it is seen as essential to life that women are the property of a man. Our bodily autonomy? Nonexistent. Even though the Republican party is taking more of it away, it's never fully been there. We see that and we understand it. So many white women decide -- let's become the property of the white man. Let's align our interests with those of the white man. Aligning our interests with the Democratic party won't get us anywhere either -- they don't care, we will just be their property. But the difference is the way power is structured among right wing politics (obv Democrats really aren't left wing but more so than Republicans). Right wing politics grant the white woman, property of the white man, a degree of power over vulnerable populations outside of the white nuclear family, such as racialized populations. This is the reasoning behind many phenomenons such as ""white women's tears"", or the weaponization of white femininity to oppress POC, specifically black men. Again, let me preface this by saying, I am NOT justifying this shit AT ALL. It's horrific and disgusting and inexcusable. If we look at situations like the murder of Emmett Till for instance, we see a white woman weaponizing her perceived vulnerability and value as a possession of her white family/community in order to confirm her value, to increase her status as human within her community. ""I'm not viewed as human, but at least this innocent black boy also isn't, and I'm preferred over him by my white male owners."" This shit is horrific. But it doesn't prove white women are the same as white men, or that misogyny isn't a problem within white families/communities. Quite the opposite, actually -- it proves that misogyny is one of the very things that leads white women to engage in and perpetrate racialized violence, as a desperate attempt to grasp onto any level of power they can possibly take hold of.

This may have been all over the place but I'm using it to express my thoughts. Again this is not an attempt to paint racist white women as poor innocent victims but to show how patriarchal structures perpetuate racialized violence and ignoring the way racist white women are influenced by them is harmful.",1668414950.0,2022-11-14 08:35:50+00:00

So firstly, my awareness of of male privilege was increased when I started walking home from work at midnight. Initially I was terrified and scared but after a few walks home in realised that as an over 6 foot man people were much more scared of me than I was of them. I realised that that's privilege, I can walk home in the dark and not he concerned about everything I see (although some people do still scare me)


Now I have also realised that it is really important for men to actively  speak against toxic male behavior.
A female friend text me to say she'd be catcalled by some teenage boys. 

Not in the past I would have laughed it off as a joke because she didn't seem bothered by it or I'd say something like 'at least you've still got it"" 
But this is the first time I said that was an awful thing to happen and I asked if she was okay 

She said she was fine but she also told be it's okay because it hasn't happened to her for a while 

It made me so sad to hear that it had happened to someone so close to me. 

So really what I have leaned is that it is so important to be proactive in condemning even the seemingly ""small"" toxic behaviors of men. Because the people that engage in the small aggressions against women are the people the go on to do bigger things. 

Men need to condemn even the small toxic masculine behaviors  in themselves, thier social groups and thier community.",1668356730.0,2022-11-13 16:25:30+00:00

I reclaimed the term ""slut."" I went to the Momentum Conference where I saw Carol Queen of the Center for Sex and Culture talk.  I chatted with Anita Wagner the Polyamory activist.  I was a member of DCBiWomen.  I gobbled up Susie Bright (Susie Sexpert the lesbian sexpert)'s books, including Sexual State of the Union, Three Kinds of Asking For It (erotica), and Sexwise.  I was a swinger and guest lecturer at a local community college annually about the swinger lifestyle.  After reading Vamps and Tramps by Camille Paglia, I decided to try my hand at sex work.  I wanted to be a sex therapist.  I had a blast.

Then I started getting into philosophy, like Stoicism, Buddhism, pessimism, misanthropy, and antinatalism.  And in that world, I met men who didn't like hookup culture, not even for themselves.  They said people who brag about sex are so lame, hooking up is so overrated, the only good thing about sex is oxytocin, etc.  I respected them for that.  I decided to forget all of that, grow up, and read a(nother type of) book for a change.

But now, I feel sexually harassed.  I have a pornish body type and get asked for nudes, asked to hook up.  It replays in my mind.  I imagine a guy harassing me to hook up with him.  When you don't hook up with a guy, they take it personally.  They can't figure out why you don't want them.  They try everything.  They don't care if you have a boyfriend.  You have to be married with kids to get them off your back.  They don't even care if THEY'RE married.  For example, a married friend of mine asked me for anal fourteen times in a row.  He started calling incessantly to meet at a hotel.

Now, if you don't hookup, you're prude shamed. People think there's something wrong with you and that you need to see a therapist.  

I think hookup culture has gone too far.  Feminism is supposed to be about Choice. You should be able to be a virgin and still a feminist.",1668091826.0,2022-11-10 14:50:26+00:00

I myself am a sex-positive feminist, but most sex positive feminists mindlessly support ANYTHING sex-related without using critical thinking.

-""Women watch pornography too!"", ""sex work is work""
Okay? Both are true, but wheres the nuance? These feminists rarely focus on how exploitative the porn industry is and how misogynistic it is in general, not sure about the exact number but if i remember correcly, 88% of popular porn videos include some form of violence and it's usually against women.

-They rarely acknowledge and talk about how sex work is dangerous, and scary.
They focus more on individual empowerment/positive narratives than structural opression and violence, when we could be focusing on both.

-A woman choosing to engage in bdsm isn't inherently feminist, just because it's her choice, and it doesn't have to be, but please stop forcibly making it seem like it is.
Why aren't the men who enjoy hitting women, acting out rape, EVER questioned?

-Yes it's a fantasy but it isn't JUST a fantasy, this reminds me of when people say age is just a number, of course this is not the same, but my point still stands.
Violent porn fuels misogynistic behavior, while simultaneously reflecting how misogynistic our society is.

-Excusing all this and labeling it as ""sex positivity"", ignoring issues regarding it, serves men, women feeling ashamed of their sexuality serves patriarchy, yes, but so does not questioning anything sex-related, even if it's obviously misogynistic degeneracy.

-WHO does this serve, as much as we don't wanna hear it, condoning ALL kinks, like violent degredation of women, r*pe play and age play, makes the world more comfortable for rapists and pedos, they can verbally express their desires with others in specific communities.

-i searched feminist on reddit, wanting to check the sub, the 4th result was a post on a sub called r*pefantisies...
And it read, trigger warning: ""it's even funnier to r*pe a feminist right? They're always the ones who fight back the most, it must be fun to remind them their place""

I repeat, communities like these give violent men an outlet for misogynistic behavior.

-Im sorry but consent doesn't make it any less misogynistic for your bf to call you a useless whore.
(Im okay with this being practiced in the bedroom as long as it's not being normalized online, but still question things)
We need to stop acting like misogyny doesn't affect men's (and women's) sexuality, and that the public expression/depiction of this violence in porn doesn't harm women,

505,Men preferring women to shave: inherently sexist or no?,133,ykdknt,Feminism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/ykdknt/men_preferring_women_to_shave_inherently_sexist/,160,"Disclaimer: I am not arguing for either side, rather trying to gauge opinions from others on a somewhat heated topic. 

If a man has a ‚Äúpreference‚Äù for women to shave specific areas of their bodies (legs, armpits, arms, privates, etc.), is it inherently sexist? Whether he realizes this or not? Women in general are expected to shave and there is undeniably a huge stigma towards those who don‚Äôt in our society. Men aren‚Äôt held to the same standards, so is having this preference for women to shave sexist? 

Let‚Äôs say the man shaves as well, and uses this to make his preference for women to shave a bit more equitable. Is it still sexist given the context of the stigma of body hair on women? 

Is he actively contributing to the hypocritical standard, or simply unaware of the underlying sexism in his preference? Or is it not sexist in the first place? 

Again, I am asking from a neutral standpoint while mentioning points from others who have discussed this topic.***",1667415271.0,2022-11-02 18:54:31+00:00

507,Lack of sexual education,15,yknsdq,Feminism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/yknsdq/lack_of_sexual_education/,4,"Lack of access to safe abortion care along with the American sex education/ lack off reproductive education/health was part of the issue I became pregnant at 14 years old.
 Now I am a 41 year old women who is still ‚Äúhealthy reproductively‚Äù, luckily my husband  had a vasectomy  after his 3 children were born, so there is no chance of pregnancy for me now. 

So the story goes when I was 13 years old a new family moved into our neighborhood in philadelphia and I met Stephanie 13.F. Her older brother took an interest in me and we started to date. NowI had never had a boyfriend and had only kissed a boy before. 
 So naive  me  was overwhelmed with a boy be interested  in me.  I was over the moon!  
So I was 13 years old and in 8th grade at a local Roman Catholic grade school. 

So my  entire sexual education was when we were brought intro a classroom in 5th grade (11-12  yrs  old) all the girls in one room boys in another. The school nurse showed us the human body in picture and in a mannequin. We talked about periods and pads. That part was not bad. Nothing about std, or pregnancy prevent, it was only abstinence before marriage.  it lasted for a total of 30 min. 

The information I received from my father was ‚Äútell them to use their fingers if they want to have sex with you.‚Äù I was 11 and had no idea what he meant. 
While my mother told me to stay out of dark alleyways that‚Äôs all. 
So needless to say when I started dating I was clueless and this boy well I should call him a man. He was 5 years my senior completely took advantage of my stupidity. 
We dated and we started having sex regularly with no protection. Now we started to date in June of 95. By December of 95 I was feeling like something was off with my body.  I told him and he told me I was crazy. I proceeded to get my period in December 3 days of bleeding so I though okay I can‚Äôt be pregnant. January came and I got my period again but it was very light and only 2 days. So now in February I got no period. March came and we decided to get a pregnancy test. 
We had to steal it from the local store. 
 ( he was homeless by this point fighting with his father and I was 14 so we had no money) and I peed on the stick under a bridge right by my house as to not get caught with it.  
It came back positive. His plan was to get  an abortion. 
Now I lived in pennsylvaina in the 1990‚Äôs which required a parent to be represent for an abortion for anyone under 18 yrs old. 
So that was out t never mind you had to do 3 day period of counseling and ultrasound before the procedure. 
So my daughters father decided we should go to New Jersey where you only need a guardian present . His older sister decided to take me and be my guardian. I went after school in April on a Monday night. They took me back to do the ultrasound I was by myself at that point. They proceeded to perform the ultrasound and then the doctor came into talk to me. I was 21 weeks along. To far for a normal second trimester abortion. If I wanted to I could go to new York and pay 3-4,000$ to have a partial birth abortion.  Or have the child and give it up for adoption or have the child. 

I honestly was so numb when they told me. I knew I would not get a partial birth abortion, I wasn‚Äôt even sure I wanted a regular one. So the choice was adoption or keeping my child. 
Save you the drama but I have 26 year old daughter who has graduated university with a degree and is the most loving caring person I know. 
Her father last saw her when she was 5 months old then I got a restraining order because he was physically and emotionally and mentally abusive through out the better half of the pregnancy especially when I could not get the abortion. 
He stalked me for about 5 more years but no contact. 
He never paid support beside the $100 he got for pawing my engagement ring.  
I raised her on my own, my family was a huge help but I worked my fucking ass off so much harder then it had to be. I wish I had gotten the information when I needed it! 
I just felt a need to share my story. 

TLDR: I got pregnant at 14 had her a week after my 15 birthday. She is 26 yrs old now no contact with dad.

A lot of people have called out the inappropriate age gap of 11 years. On top of that, the present power imbalance, as Billie has been a fan of Jesse since she was a young teen, and has even talked about The Neighborhood (Jesse‚Äôs band) having a huge influence on her. Jesse has known Billie since she first started making headlines as a teenage artist. This past weekend the two were spotted at a halloween party together, Billie dressed as a baby and Jesse dressed as an old man. Many are assuming this is them pointing fun at the age gap commentary happening on social media right now. 

Billie has written music about being groomed before, she‚Äôs talked about being taken advantage of by older men, and people are taking this as an opportunity to call her an insensitive hypocrite. I‚Äôve seen comments online of people saying ‚Äúshe‚Äôs knows what she‚Äôs doing‚Äù or ‚Äúshe‚Äôs just making a mockery of victims.‚Äù But here‚Äôs the thing, SHES STILL A VICTIM. I‚Äôve seen so many insensitive comments spewed at the young woman being taken advantage of and a lot less commentary on the man 10 years her senior seeking out someone he‚Äôs known since she was a teenager. And i‚Äôll call it what it is: misogyny. 

We see this victim blaming time and time again on social media, consistently prevalent through women victims speaking publicly about being made a victim, and only blamed further. Lets be honest. I‚Äôm sure months, years, even maybe decades from now, she‚Äôll realize she‚Äôs being take advantage of, and that‚Äôs truly heartbreaking to think about.

528,Misogynistic attackers should be charged with terrorism offences,26,yi2sow,Feminism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/yi2sow/misogynistic_attackers_should_be_charged_with/,25,"Although, these types of attacks fall under the legal definition of terrorism in a number of countries (including the US, Aus and Canada), I will refer to the UK definition under Section I of the Terrorism Act (2000) for ease of reference. 

It specifies that terrorism is the use or threat of action that is designed to influence the government or an international government organisation, or to intimidate the public, or a section of the public, and is made for the purpose of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause. 

In the list of extremist movements (used to classify the potential threat of terrorist attacks), animal rights and environmental groups are included however, extremist misogyny/incels/MRA groups do not make the list. How is it that groups such as animal rights groups (that have not resulted in any deaths) are included, extreme misogyny, that has resulted in a number of deaths of both men and women, are not even on the radar? 

Well, we would have to look at the current state of affairs. The former president of the United States called participants in the Black Lives Matter protests ‚Äúterrorists‚Äù and those who participated in the attack on the Capitol ‚Äúgood people‚Äù. When women MP‚Äôs advised Boris Johnson that his public statements about women resulted in them receiving more death and rape threats (than usual!), he responded by describing these safety complaints as ‚Äúhumbug‚Äù. Pauline Hanson sought an enquiry into domestic violence claiming that women were the instigators purely based on rhetoric and misinformation circulated by MRA‚Äôs. 

These are classic examples of of ‚Äúshit trickling downhill‚Äù. The conduct of these influential men and women has enabled and emboldened misogynistic groups. If Trump were to say ‚ÄúI think the Quran is really great‚Äù then dare I say, there would be an alternative response from these groups. 

Even in instances where we have manifestos written by these attackers, there is no mention of their misogynistic proclivities in the media. For example, Elliot Rodgers manifesto was mentioned by a number of media outlets following the shooting at the University of California. 

They referred to sections of the manifesto where Rodger cried in his beer about being bullied and victimised. None, mentioned his references to women as ‚Äúbeasts‚Äù, ‚Äúthe ultimate evil‚Äù and his belief that ‚Äúthere is no creature more evil and depraved than the human female.‚Äù The media referred to him as ‚Äútroubled‚Äù and ‚Äúfrustrated‚Äù. At no time immediately following the shootings, did they mention ‚Äúterrorist, ‚Äúextremist‚Äù, ‚Äúmisogyny‚Äù or ‚Äúincel‚Äù. 

These attacks fall within the legal definition of terrorism yet, offenders are unlikely to be labelled as terrorists by the media. They are more likely to be referred to as a ‚Äúlone wolf‚Äù with mental health issues‚Ä¶provided they are white, of course. White supremacy and extreme misogynist groups are aligned in their belief systems and is evident in the way that they radicalise their minions online. 

96% of terrorist attacks are committed by men, they are the main offenders in domestic violence cases (these offences are both clearly linked and yet ignored as significant warning signs of potential escalation to acts of terror) and the media is clearly reluctant to refer to white men as ‚Äúterrorists‚Äù however, overtly comfortable with referring to Islamic offenders as ‚Äúterrorists‚Äù. 

The point I‚Äôm trying to make, is that violence against women, has been normalised by the media, political leaders and the circulation of misinformation and racial prejudice. MRA‚Äôs, incels etc do not do research. What they call ‚Äúresearch‚Äù is simply completing a google search for information that supports their already formed views. They rely on pseudo science and false statistics. This is tantamount to scrolling through Facebook while you are on the toilet. 

Oddly enough, the members of this group know nothing about feminism which they claim to despise. They think feminism is a man hating movement etc when feminists, put simply, want equality for all genders. If anything, these groups ought to be supporting feminism because the issues they consistently complain about e.g. mens suicide rate/mental health are the exact issues that feminists support in resolving. 

In saying that, the last thing that the leaders in the manosphere want, is to resolve these issues. The misogynistic ideology ventilated in the manosphere is cyclical and fuelled by sadness, loneliness, insecurity, rejection and misdirection from intellectually superior leaders, who have been able to monetise the movement. They are able to present highly misogynistic views in a more easily digestible form (read here, Jordan Peterson) instead of yelling ‚Äúlegalise rape!"" from the rooftops. 

Without perpetuating this cycle of misinformation, the leaders in these communities would cause an income stream to become defunct. Therefore, it is self-serving for them to continue to exercise influence over their intellectually inferior followers. At no point, do their followers ask themselves whether these individuals have an agenda or question their credibility, showing they lack the skills and capabilities to think critically. 

This causes derailment of the issues that feminists really want to address and we are then tasked with educating indoctrinated individuals as opposed to rectifying the serious matters. We are presented with highly rare and individualised issues which detract from progress.

There is a seriously flawed and concerning misconception that these extreme misoginistic groups are fringe groups with a few ‚Äúbad apples‚Äù. This is not the case and men and women of influence such as (Trump, Johnson and Hanson), need to be held accountable, the violence against women and attacks in the name of extreme misogyny ought to be treated with the same seriousness of terrorist attacks against other groups. 

For any of anti-feminist lurkers on here, I‚Äôm not interested in your ‚Äúnot all men‚Äù and ‚Äúone time this happened to me and therefore men are the real victims‚Äù DMs. I don‚Äôt care about your personal anecdotal experiences, feminism is a movement that is far beyond that, it encapsulates the experiences of women of many cultures around the world.

529,Taylor Swift as a lens into men rejecting art they don't understand,346,yhfjug,Feminism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/yhfjug/taylor_swift_as_a_lens_into_men_rejecting_art/,162,"**ask a (straight, white) man ""What do you think of Taylor Swift?"",**

and you're likely to get one of two answers. either:

1. this man is tapped into the culture-- he's learned that being a 'stan' gets him in our good graces--¬†and he hits you with a ""she‚Äôs dope"". promptly after, in good ole i'm-not-like-other-guys fashion, he asks you to add Love Story to the queue. (you don‚Äôt add it... deep cuts only.)

or

2.  he is quiet for an entire one-Mississippi, two-Mississippi. he looks past you or away from you. maybe he does understand the weight of the question and is preparing how to approach, maybe he doesn't understand the weight of it. if you're speaking to this man out at a bar, maybe he's deciding whether he likes you enough-- wants to bring you home enough-- to pretend that, yeah, he does like Taylor Swift. most often, though, you'll feel him pull away from you, from the conversation. he doesn‚Äôt like Taylor Swift. he thinks's she's untalented, the girl who sleeps around and writes songs about her exes. a real cruel she-devil even, perhaps. he's almost, you notice, angry about her success, her fame, the way she is beloved by so many.

i'm interested in digging into this second group of men-- in their view of Miss Swift as a window into a much broader phenomenon.

i'm so incredibly intrigued at the correlation between men being angry about things they do not understand. about art they cannot relate to. about the expression of feelings they've never felt.

I'll unpack this through some comparisons.

&#x200B;

**a man's** ***Clean*** **may be** ***Lucid Dreams***

at the first thanksgiving break from college, my high school boyfriend told me he‚Äôd listened to *Lucid Dreams* by Juice WRLD, like, a ton of times the few weeks after i broke up with him.

me, personally? i would never add any Juice WRLD to my breakup comfort playlist. probably because i don‚Äôt relate to his narratives around heartbreak, the kinds of feelings his lyrics invoke, and so on.

&#x200B;

**however,** **what i wouldn‚Äôt do** **is undermine his value as an artist.**

i wouldn‚Äôt negate the value of that song entirely, because I, in my singular experience, don‚Äôt relate to it.

i wouldn‚Äôt call Juice WRLD untalented, i wouldn't judge you for listening to it, understanding that different art elicits different reactions based on experiences.

in fact, if you-- a friend, boyfriend, <person i care about>-- simply adored Juice WRLD, i would actively try to get into his music, so we could share that together. if, after giving it a fair shot, i still just don't enjoy it, i'd probably just sit through it anyway, knowing it makes you happy. or, maybe i'd suggest a song i know we both like.

&#x200B;

**like, no, i've never liked football...**

but that dislike has never translated into looking down on those who enjoy it. i've never invalidated the excitement of superfans on their team's big day.

even if i wanted to, you wouldn't care. you are the deciders of society. you decide which forms of music and art, which interests and pastimes, are valid and valuable and legitimate.

so i'll sit with my brothers in the living room every Superbowl Sunday, not questioning why exactly they enjoy watching these men concuss each other, what great entertainment value they find in this drawn out performance starring Tom Brady.

i'll sit with them, get screamed at when i try to change the channel on commercial break because their interest is the only one that matters on that day, and so ill just enjoy their enjoyment. it's the only thing i can do.

i'll start to look forward to that yearly Sunday, too. not only for the nachos, but also because i associated that day with my brothers' excitement, their happiness.

&#x200B;

**when women don't relate, we empathize.**

our instinct is not to shame, to invalidate.

we figure out how to relate to you. we have to, in order to be accepted by you. and, ultimately, your acceptance of us is vital to our existence, our safety.

or, we stay quiet. we leave it alone. we reserve our judgements.

&#x200B;

**when men don't relate, they reject.**

they devalue that which does not make sense to them.

unable to compute that there can be emotions, feelings, ground truths, different than their own...

that our first person consciousness' are as complex as theirs, yet we exist in a society entirely different than the one they live in,  leading us to our own set of interests, our own form of art, that they can't understand...

so they trivialize, they invalidate, they mock.

&#x200B;

**thus, asking a man about content which is made my women and appeals  primarily to women**

provides a beautiful window into:

\- his capacity to see outside of himself, his singular perspective.

\- his capacity to overcome the fundamental belief he walks around with each day-- that his lens of the world is the one and only true reality of everything.

\- his capacity to recognize that there is art which is shaped by experiences, interests, and a female existence which he might not understand... and maybe to relate to it or appreciate it nonetheless, as women have done with male art and male interests forever.

\- his capacity to accept that the female experience is as valid and visceral as his own.

So my last job was at a warehouse which I worked at for a little less than a year. I was put into a position and instantly was reprimanded for being a woman. The boss constantly yelled at us and put us down (whatever). So after a while my coworkers all quit/got fired. I was left so obviously I became the ""boss/leader"" of that area. WELL, STORYTIME. One time I was doing all the workload by myself, very fast as I always do, and one of the men were jacking/messing around. He had his phone tilted towards me and it seemed he was taking pictures of me. So, I asked him, ""Why are you taking pictures of me?"" his response, ""you need to be careful talking about things like that, I could get in serious trouble with you saying stuff like that, thats not okay"" and talking down to me like I was a child. I yelled at him ""WALK AWAY! WALK AWAY!"" and after that I was told people were talking about me saying ""Yeah, she is CUTE but she is really FIESTY"" which made me so upset because 1) I was standing up for myself as anyone should and 2) Instead of being labeled as strong like a man would i was labeled as ""fiesty""

So being the boss of this area, there was a new guy put on the floor, which meant I had to train him. So I did. One day I noticed he was doing the job COMPLETELY wrong after I had showed him how to do it correctly about 3-5 times, so I said something to him about it. He continued to do the parts wrong and then said to me ""You know something, you're a MEAN GIRL aren't you?"" I got so mad I just walked away. Any other time it would have been extremely inappropriate to say this to a boss/superior, but he felt he could get away with it simply because I am a woman.

I try to work hard in every single job I do. But I will never be appreciated for that the way that men are appreciated for their hard labor because I am a woman. I will always be labeled as feisty or too serious or whatever and never respected.",1667166998.0,2022-10-30 21:56:38+00:00

I could be wrong too (hope not), maybe it's just that a lot of writers actually get female characters wrong and male characters right. Also, when these Mary Sues are called out, I don't get to see many people giving examples of well-written female characters in order to show how to write a female character properly.

I feel it's fine to call out a lot of poorly written female characters, but it would be good if a similar amount of coverage of properly written female characters as well as poorly written male characters could also be done, which I don't get to see much on the Internet. And this leads me into believing the cause behind these double standards in the coverage and criticism of types of characters of both genders is sexism.

Also, I've actually noticed that a lot of the female characters who are being criticized (and in some cases hated) come from movies/video games/literary works under the ""Action/Adventure"" genre since I don't see a similar criticism of female protagonists/supporting characters from other genres (Romance, Slice-of-Life, Horror, Comedy, etc.).

I am trying to give House of Dragon a chance but George RR Martin's fetish for violence and oppression of women clearly made it into the prequel as well.

Similarly women in Bridgerton are still not supposed to work, marry up, etc.

If we are going to create fictitious worlds where dragons exist and all races live together in medieval fantasy peace, is it such a stretch to dream up some female equality as well?

544,A Personal Experience of Misogyny,28,yg7iv5,Feminism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/yg7iv5/a_personal_experience_of_misogyny/,17,"Recently, I've been thinking about my personal experience of misogyny, and I thought I'd share the reflections I've made about myself as someone who used to treat women poorly and still struggles to fight my preconceived notions. To truly understand how I became this person, we have to go back to the very beginning and work our way up.
¬†

I was born into a typical western family. I had brothers but no sisters. In kindergarten, I didn't really have an understanding of gender. At that age, there wasn't much difference between a boy and a girl. I had both male and female friends. Good so far.
¬†

In late elementary, that began to change, I became more aware of the idea of romantic relationships, and even that early on, there was talk among other kids about liking girls and getting girlfriends. Mostly harmless childhood stuff, but as a shy boy, it was the first rift between boys and girls in my eyes. I was nervous talking to girls my age.
¬†

This trend grew into middle school, and the idea of sexuality was added to it. I learned societal norms about relationships and sex, both from media and from friends who had no idea what they were talking about. Since I still had male and female friends, this is all a normal part of growing up. But this is where the issues began.
¬†

I went to a boys-only high school, and suddenly I wasn't interacting with girls my age at all. I no longer had female friends. The idea of single-gender schools is for the students to be able to focus on studies without the distractions of the other gender, but I would argue this results in severe social stunting, and I'll explain why.
¬†

As a shy, nerdy, often bullied teenager in high school, I didn't really go out much. Life was, go to school, go home, repeat. No extracurricular activities, no opportunities to interact with people outside of my school. So what does that mean in regards to my experience with women? It meant that, for the majority of my teenage years, the only women I ever interacted with was my mom, extended family members, and teachers. Family, authority figures, and people older than me. Although this was good for teaching me how to treat older women, I couldn't exactly model how I treated my mom to how I treat girls my age, that would be weird.
¬†

So how did I learn about girls my age? The answer is media. TV shows, movies, and video games. I'm sure many of the people on this subreddit already understand how young women and teenage girls are portrayed in media. They are highly sexualized and infantilized. Worse still is the interactions between men and these women. Overtly sexual themes are often seen, and the main ""good"" men are shown harrasing, belitting, sometimes sexually assaulting women. Crucially, they often get away with these acts and are sometimes rewarded for them. A couple great YouTube channels that have videos on these subjects are:
¬†

https://www.youtube.com/c/PopCultureDetective
¬†

https://www.youtube.com/c/CinemaTherapySolutions
¬†

(Funny how the only ones I know about are hosted by men, shows that I still have issues listening to women)
¬†

On top of this, is the enormous societal pressure that was placed on me at that age. I was led to believe that the worth of a man is defined by his sexual activities and his relationship status. This was emphasised in some way by literally everyone. Friends, family, teachers, media, they all had some opinion on men's sexual status. Since I never interacted with girls my age, I obviously stayed single and a virgin. This had massive damaging effects on my self esteem and general well-being, I believed I was worthless because I never had sex with a woman.
¬†

So, combine all this together into one depressed wreck of a teenager and throw me into university, where I was now suddenly surrounded with women my age and there were no authority figures to control and guide me anymore.
¬†

Disaster.
¬†

I'm ashamed to admit that I treated women terribly for a long time. I ruined good friendships, hurt a lot of people, I made women feel uncomfortable and sometimes unsafe. I committed the same acts as those done by the ""heroes"" on TV in order to desperately find my self-worth in some poor woman. My inexposure to women my age meant I never got to see them as human beings, only as objects of sexual desire. Although I never physically hurt anyone, I'm sure some women feared that I might. I caused severe emotional damage to innocent people.
¬†

At this point, I'll make the important disclaimer that my actions were entirely my fault. There were plenty of opportunities for me to be better, and I was not. The women I hurt were especially not at fault, it was all me.
¬†

Once it all came crumbling around me, and I realised that women were not the ones responsible for fixing my broken psyche. I slowly built myself back up, but while my self-respect grew, the misogyny stayed. In some ways, it got worse. As I gained self-confidence I also gained skill in my ability to interact with women for my own personal gain. Since now I was starting to live a happier life, I must be doing good, right? I still treated women badly, and it was only by getting called out and facing consequences for my actions.
¬†

If there is one thing to learn from this essay, it is this. Misogynists and abusers will NEVER become better people unless they face criticism and consequences. Do not let them get away with it. It is the best thing for their victims, and it is, in fact, the best thing for them as well.
¬†

It was only once I truly understood the pain I was causing that I finally started to improve. It is a long road to recovery. Years on, I still catch myself being sexist or thinking sexist thoughts, I'm still surrounded in a patriarchal society with sexist media and sexist people. It destroys the minds of young boys and girls and creates this rift between them that shouldn't exist. We're all in this together, after all. My actions were all my fault, but they never would've happened if I wasn't encouraged and allowed to do them by society.",1667010328.0,2022-10-29 02:25:28+00:00

On **16 September 2022, a 22-year-old Iranian woman** named Mahsa Amini, also known as Jina Amini, died in a hospital in Tehran, Iran, under suspicious circumstances. The Guidance Patrol, the religious morality police of Iran's government, arrested Amini for not wearing the hijab in accordance with government standards.

Amini's death resulted in a [series of protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahsa_Amini_protests), described by [CNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN) as more widespread than the protests in 2009, 2017, and 2019,[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Mahsa_Amini#cite_note-12) and by [*The New York Times*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times) as the largest Iranian protests since at least 2009.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Mahsa_Amini#cite_note-13) Some female demonstrators removed their hijab or publicly cut their hair as acts of protest.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Mahsa_Amini#cite_note-14) By October 2022, [Iran Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_Human_Rights) reported that at least 201 people were killed by security forces confronting protests across the country;[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Mahsa_Amini#cite_note-15)[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Mahsa_Amini#cite_note-16) [Amnesty International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International) reported that Iranian security forces were, in some cases, firing into groups with live ammunition, and in other cases were killing protesters by beating them with batons.",1667000144.0,2022-10-28 23:35:44+00:00

You can search it as it goes by the patriarchy argument by Jordan Peterson! 

For this, the anchor gives many reasons as to how the majority of wealth is owned by man, & the maximum unpaid labour is done by women.

He counters this argument by saying that the % of such scenarios is very less. & Goes on to say that the majority of people in prison are men, most disaffected are men and so on. 

Now the thing is Am I missing out something here or is the most illogical thing I've ever heard!? 

So, while talking about male-dominance, we're striving for a society where the dominance is held by no specific gender. And if we go by his argument, the most amount of violence is inflicted upon women by men, not to mention domestic violence. in India, the reality is much much worse! The unpaid labour is just one aspect that women should just accept it as a way of life! There is so much more to that. 

Not giving the freedom & independence to make decisions, not being given a chair at the table for making important family decisions, the gender-pay gap & Yes, while the situation might be changing for better in urban cities, rural is far from worse.

I recently learned of a huge problem in healthcare **that most negatively affects women**, and I would love to hear people‚Äôs reactions, experiences and thoughts on it: 

When I was 19 years old I walked into the office of the head of the spinal department at a leading hospital. I‚Äôd been suffering from debilitating chronic back pain to the point of not being able to function for 3 years prior, following a major spinal surgery when I was 16.

The doctor heard my story, and asked me to step out of the room so he could speak privately to my father, who had accompanied me. My father and I were both taken aback. I‚Äôm the patient, and I‚Äôm an adult. But I stepped out.

My father came out a few minutes later. ‚ÄòHe said there‚Äôs no physiological reason for your pain. That it‚Äôs in your head, and that you‚Äôre depressed‚Äô.

I was dumbstruck. By the cavalier misdiagnosis, by the stinging dismissal of pain that was completely wrecking my life, and by the disrespect of not discussing it with me directly.

I slowly walked to the car, barely able to stand from the pain, with the proverbial ‚Äòit‚Äôs in your head‚Äô writing off that women have been dealing with for centuries ringing in my ears. I felt helpless, scared and alone.

12 years and \~40 doctors later I am now completely pain free thanks, in part, to medical professionals who believed in me, and worked with me in partnership to help me overcome my pain.

I‚Äôve since often wondered how many other young women receive similar feedback. In retrospect I wish I had shared more about my journey earlier - maybe it could have helped others in knowing they‚Äôre **not alone, that they should never accept dismissal or bias, and that there is hope.**

I recently experienced another gross misdiagnosis of someone close to me, this time a cancer diagnosis with much more severe consequences. 

Following this I found myself waking up at night, wondering if these experiences were just a coincidence, or if there‚Äôs something that could be done differently. I did some research and what I learned **shocked me to my core.** 

I learned that medical dismissal, gaslighting and misdiagnosis is far from just my experience. In fact, it‚Äôs **one of the biggest problems in healthcare.**

That medical errors are the **3rd leading cause of death** in the US, following only cancer and heart disease.

That every year **40,000-80,000** Americans die from **preventable diagnostic errors** alone.

That when you walk into a Doctor‚Äôs office, **1 In 10 times** you will be misdiagnosed. And if you have a serious medical condition, it‚Äôs **1 in 5 times.**

I also learned that errors in diagnosis happen much more to **women, people of color, members of the LGBTQ community, and people with emotional challenges.**

That, for example, female-specific conditions such as endometriosis, often **take 10 years or more** to be diagnosed.

That women are **50% more likely** to be misdiagnosed following a heart attack than men.

That women of color have **3.5 times the mortality rate of white women** during and after pregnancy, similar to women in developing countries.

And that LGBTQ people are **twice as likely** than others to feel their provider dismissed their concerns or assumed something about them without asking.

The last thing I learned, and this is what shocked me the most, is that the healthcare system seems to view this as **business as usual.**

Imagine an airline where 10% of planes crash because of human error and bias. **Now imagine that when that plane is filled with women or minority populations, it crashes even more.** How long would this airline stay in business? Would we continue buying tickets for our parents and children?

Wouldn‚Äôt you think that these numbers would constitute **a state of emergency** and that fixing it would be the top priority?

Instead, this problem is often being swept under the rug.

I‚Äôve already come across **hundreds of stories** of people from all walks of life dismissed and misdiagnosed by the healthcare system.

**And we are all dealing with this alone, and aren‚Äôt learning enough from the experiences of others.**

This is why I decided to share my story and to offer those interested to create a space for **learning about this problem and how we can combat bias in medicine, for sharing our stories, for supporting one another and for consulting with one another**, in order to **protect ourselves and our loved one‚Äôs** when receiving healthcare.

I feel it‚Äôs up to us to change this reality. We need to come out and share our stories, until we can‚Äôt be ignored anymore. And we need to create supportive spaces where we can get advice, discuss what action we can take, and support one another before and after these experiences.

If you‚Äôd like to be part of a community with this focus, **you‚Äôre welcome to join here:**[ **https://www.facebook.com/groups/medicalmisdiagnosis**](https://www.facebook.com/groups/medicalmisdiagnosis)

I would also love to hear any feedback, thoughts or experiences. 

My hope is that we can together help create a powerful force for much better healthcare, one that is more equitable, more respectful and more exceptional, for the benefit of ourselves, our parents and our children.

Jeju Island's ‚Äòhaenyeo‚Äô are considered to be South Korea‚Äôs first working mothers, breaking the traditionally patriarchal societal norms to be the breadwinners for their families.

The term haenyeo refers to the island women who earn their living by diving into the sea to pluck abalone, clam, seaweed, sea cucumber, sea urchin, and squid from the bottom of the strait. These women have been doing this job for the past 1700 years and are considered an aberration in a typically male-dominated Korean society. These women established diving to be an exclusively female occupation.

In the 1970s the country experienced a boom in the export of seafood and the sea women became quite prosperous because of the demand. But this also led to their focus shifting towards providing better education and career prospects to their children. As a result, a new generation of women started slowly abandoning the profession. The number of haenyeo has dwindled over time as the younger generations began to look at other more lucrative employment opportunities.

As a Hawaii-based professional free diver, Kimi Werner shares the opinion of one of the haenyeo:

>‚ÄúYeah, that makes us sad, but at the same time, we chose not to pass this down to our daughters. We chose to use the money we earned to get our daughters educated so that they would have more opportunities \[than we had\]‚Äô.‚Äù

As of 2016, there were less than 3,000 haenyeo left, with most of the women over the age of 60. Still, these women continue the tradition and do this perilous work proudly. In fact, their strong work ethic and contribution to society have also earned them a mention in the UNESCO list of Korea‚Äôs intangible cultural heritage in 2016.

>‚ÄúI do not love you, I will not marry you.‚Äù

In modern times, the above sentence from any girl would hardly evoke any response or even raise eyebrows. But in the mid-1960s, it was considered blasphemy of the highest order in Italy, where honor and respect had been engrained and deeply rooted in the minds of the Italian people for generations.

Opposing these traditions would result in absolute shame for the person and their family.

Franca Viola was a trailblazer. In 1966, Franca Viola became the first Italian woman who refused to marry her rapist to ‚Äòuphold‚Äô her family‚Äôs honor. Her statement became a rallying cry for other women to follow suit. Franca not only took her rapist to court, but also won the case against all odds, managing to put her perpetrators behind bars for 11 years.

In 1970, Italian director Damiano Damiani immortalized Franca Viola in celluloid by creating the movie The Most Beautiful Wife, starring Ornella Muti. Her case also led to important changes in the Italian legal system and paved the way for equal rights for women.

Later in life, when Franca was asked what made her take this courageous step, she simply said.

>‚ÄúIt was not a courageous gesture. I only did what I felt I had to do, as any other girl would do today. I listened to my heart.‚Äù

I once snapped at these friends (each separately) and at that moment I could not explain to them that I'm pissed because its almost always men doing this shit. ""I'm upset"" is met with, are you sure? Or, when I say, I'm not mad, really, I'm met with ""really"". I wasn't then, but I am now that you question me.

my two other male friends gives me pet names and I told them a few times not to do it, but even though they apologize after they treat it like a joke. and I have no ides how to explain to them that every fucking person who gave me a pet name was a man with bad intentions.

All of my other classmates but one were men who already had experience despite it being a beginner class. 

At one point, one of the guys reached out to me via the class discord chat, and asked for my snapchat. I obliged hoping I might gain a friend, but after he started sending me shirtless gym videos my hopes were dashed. 

Although I want to pursue coding again because of how much I enjoyed it, I ultimately left it because I saw no future for myself in such a male-dominated field. I didn‚Äôt wanna end up stuck working in an environment that would be hostile towards me. I‚Äôve changed my major since then and would still like to code for fun and because it would be helpful for what I‚Äôm going into (statistics).

Sorry I am so new to Reddit. I just never thought I would need to make a post like this, but I am soooo frustrated with my job that I do not know where else to turn and vent. I figured this community might understand and provide me some comfort.

I am a bisexual, POC, 27 year old woman and my pronouns are she/her. I currently hold a position as an accounting consultant for Deloitte, and when I first got the job I was sooo excited. This was my dream company that I have worked so many years for through all the ups and downs of life, college undergrad, masters program, past positions, etc. Part of the reason I was so excited was because Deloitte claims to be a safe space for women, but as I reach the midpoint of my current project, I am starting to see an illusion of safety for women in the workplace.

Being accepted as one of the few women on my current project, I was already feeling uneasy and confused. Regardless, I have taken on all the work they gave me and I am accomplishing a lot. So far I have even accomplished more on the project than the rest of my team members, and this is documented in the application that tracks our time. You would think all would be going well for me, but so far the way the men have treated me has crossed the line...

One issue with the Deloitte men is that I have caught them several times speaking on my behalf or putting words in my mouth to the client and our managers, and every time it is my words twisted to sound negative. This only leaves me caught off-guard and having to defend controversial opinions that I usually do not even have. The worst part is that despite my accomplishments on this project so far, I have also been treated differently after having to defend myself.

When I brought this up to my manager at Deloitte, and told him that I do not appreciate men speaking for me, or anyone for that matter, they told me they would do something. So far nothing has changed. Except that one of these misogynists was given a promotion and now I am left doing his work for him, on top of my own work. Which should not come as a surprise I guess since us Deloitte women are always doing the men's work.

Lately, there also seems to be an attempt to exclude me from important meetings, as if I am not respected enough to hear what is being said in those meetings. When I ask someone if I may attend, I get shrugged off or directed to ask another male attendee in leadership. Do not even get me started about the time I asked one of these misogynists, and he proceeded to say, ""I think you are a big girl, so you can go ask Glenn yourself."" I wasn't asking Glenn, I was asking you...

I can go on and on about this company's disregard for women. From my own personal stories, to stories where some of sister coworkers have been laughed at by men in leadership for their work, to stories of male gaze. When does it end? Why are we doing more of the work and getting less of the respect? Why lie to us and tell us that your offices are a safe place for women? Especially when we are bringing these problems to your attention and nothing is happening. It makes going to work very discouraging and unsafe. It literally feels like the men know they can get away with anything, and laugh at our claims of abuse behind our backs and hold grudges about it.

I just do not know what to do anymore. This was supposed to be my dream job. As big and well-known as Deloitte is, you would think they cared about these things, but it feels like the Deloitte patriarchy is using social justice claims as a diversion while the men continue to abuse the female workers. If a ""Big 4 Company"" cannot make women feel safe in 2022, can any company? 

This is sooo depressing :(",1666127207.0,2022-10-18 21:06:47+00:00

643,The Amouranth situation should change people's mind about sex work,861,y6g1ab,Feminism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/y6g1ab/the_amouranth_situation_should_change_peoples/,153,"Throwaway because I have coworkers on my other account and I don't want this controversial opinion known in my work place.

&#x200B;

Let me preface this post by saying this : I believe that sex work is work, I believe that sex work should be decriminalized  because that is the only way to provide a safe environment for the sex workers, an environment in which they feel safe to report assault. However, I believe that sex work, like any other type of work under capitalism, is exploitative. But, there is an added layer of misogyny thrown in the middle. Most sex workers are women, most sollicitors are men, most pimps are men, and I don't think you can analyze this phenomenon outside of the patriarchal lens. Therefore, I can not, in good faith, repeat the slogan ""sex work is empowering"", I believe the vast majority of sex workers are abused, and I abhore the liberal feminist way of glamorizing sex work, especially to impressionable young teens.

&#x200B;

If you don't know who Amouranth is, she is one of the top twitch streamers and if i'm not mistaken, one of the earliest to start the Hot Tub streams. She also has an OF and has been making over a million dollars a month on both of these platforms. She is what many would refer to as an independent sex worker, she's not working with a porno production company, she is her own boss and has people working FOR her. Yesterday, she went live on twitch and revealead live and with proof, that she has been abused by her husband of 7 years, that HE was the one to force her to become The Amouranth that we all know today. She was even forced to keep their marriage a secret because it would ""damage the brand"" according to him, it was kept so secretive that not even people who have met her and streamed with her multiple times knew about it. Basically, she had been trafficked this whole time, while being used as an example of someone who willingly performs sex work, being evidence that sex work can be empowering.

&#x200B;

This situation was the final nail in the coffin for me, I have kept the possibility that a few sex workers may be doing this with no brainwashing and no coercion, but after everything that came out, I can not, in good faith, entertain this possibility. Amouranth had a documentary done on her in which she stated she was happy with what she was doing out of her own volition, so I can not help but wonder how many other sex workers who do it out of their own volition are lying about it. 

&#x200B;

Now, this isn't to say that we shouldn't believe them, or stop them from doing it, I am not even blaiming Amouranth for lying about this, and I absolutely unequivocally stand with her, she is a victim of abuse and deserves all the support she can get. My argument is about the bigger picture, feminists can not continue to defend sex work as a respectable arena for women, it is abusive, dehumanizing, and dangerous. Here, we had the case of a woman who seemed to be doing it all on her own, coupled with the statements of several former sex workers, the glamorization of places such as OF needs to end. We need an honest discussion around the topic, I understand that many believe that if we state how exploitative sex work can be, we're going to be contributing to the stigma and therefore danger that sex workers face, but I believe there is a way to stand up for sex workers, without dragging more gullible young victims into this dangerous job.",1666025191.0,2022-10-17 16:46:31+00:00

And it's really hard to move around at school and during transportation, especially for students who go by bus, in some cases people even trying to look up the skirt. Also it's especially hard to deal with wearing white clothes on your periods. But the government won't take action against it because of ""culture"" And there are barely any women there to even decide is a white dress as the uniform is practical, who have had the experience of wearing that uniform to school (the female representation in the government of my country is very low), But it isn't our culture either, our traditional clothes of men and women only have a few differences, girls being limited to the dress is something that came from the time of British colonization, and while the British has moved on from that, we still limit our schoolgirls to a dress, also, we still have the education system and uniform, which was situated in the 19th century, and barely anything have changed since,  And even if the government *did* make trousers an option, there could be possibility that male monks who does political work than religious work would step in and cause problems as they did with the country's sex education. Should we tolerate this or should we take action against this?

Isn‚Äôt that a stretch?,120,y5iblm,Feminism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/y5iblm/is_the_childfree_movement_now_anti_feminist_isnt/,82,"I keep seeing videos online and stuff of people say the child-free movement has gone haywire and is now anti-feminist. What do you think? The idea is that the discourse has gone beyond ‚Äú I choose not to have kids‚Äù to ‚ÄúI dislike kids and women who have kids and take up space‚Äù. For example, videos of women showing their postpartum bodies and instead of being encouraging the comments will say ‚Äú and this why I don‚Äôt have kids‚Äù. Or isolating new mothers and reducing them to just their titles by saying ‚Äúall they do is talk about their kids‚Äù. On the flip side I see a lot of mothers saying it‚Äôs because they lose their friends once they become mothers, so all they end up having to talk about is there kids since that‚Äôs all they do for a while. I feel like I‚Äôm explaining this SO poorly üòÇ. I just wanted to know everyone‚Äôs views. Personally, as a parent I totally get not wanting kids in certain spaces. They might be too loud and all that. But I have noticed as a mother that there is no public safe space for me and my son. Society, women included do treat me differently and it‚Äôs not a nice feeling. It‚Äôs like we can‚Äôt exist in public anymore and he gets shamed for being a child when we were all like that. And I * get shamed for being in public spaces with other adults. People shouldn‚Äôt have kids if they don‚Äôt want to obviously. I‚Äôm one and done and motherhood has been too hard for me. So, I totally get that. But a lot of the child free stuff I see is so damn rude sometimesüòÇ. Quite literally just shitting on my existence as a women/mother. Especially the contrast on speaking on womens postpartum bodies and mens ‚Äúdad bod‚Äù. I‚Äôve never just got why they shouldn‚Äôt say they don‚Äôt want kids without dragging women and kids down.

I find it interesting that I hear these comments predominantly from men.
OF COURSE women absorb crime media.  From a young age, any time a woman is subjected to violence the inevitable response is to pick apart what she did wrong or excuse the perpetrator. (From the schoolyard retort that, ""he just has a crush on you,"" to, ""he couldn't help himself with how you were dressed- you asked for it."")

You don't think that victim blaming women from childhood isn't going to encourage an interest in researching why horrible things happen to women?
Every time someone is raped or murdered, the inevitable lists are shared for how to protect yourself, when to go for a jog and where. Check your car, don't park in a dark area, make sure you're in public ALWAYS...  The response to violence against women is to focus on OUR behavior.  We're told to be prepared to prevent or own assault every waking moment. Now they're telling me I'm sick and twisted for developing an interest about it?

The thing that concerns me is the possibility that these female artists may not be dressing like they are or dancing like they are because they want to. I worry that they may feel pressured to do things like Twerk on stage because they feel it's the only way to succeed in this primarily male dominated genre, like there music couldn't stand on its own.

Do I think there are women who do it as a means of sexual liberation? Hell yes, and more power to them but the thing is I can name like five female artists who are extremely sexualized and like one who isn't, even going back to the days of Salt-N-Pepa.

I wear leggings and a pump cover and a sports bra. I look cute and it makes me feel confident in my workout not to mention it helps me cool down to take off the pump cover because I really go hard during my workouts. 

I have noticed stares from men but I ignore them and just mind my business. Sometimes they just want the equipment you‚Äôre on. Tonight as I was momentarily sitting in my car before heading home from the gym, a man (one i actually thought had been ogling me) waved me down from his car that was parked right beside me. 

I rolled down my window and said, ‚Äúeverything good?‚Äù I felt I already knew what was coming and I wasn‚Äôt looking forward to it. He said, ‚ÄúHey I just wanted to let you know that there‚Äôs guys following you around in the gym and talking about you. Guy stuff. They even ran to the window to look out as you left to see what car was yours‚Äù 

I was instantly appalled, that was not what I was expecting him to say, I asked what they looked like and he gave me what they were wearing but I don‚Äôt pay too much attention to others in the gym and definitely don‚Äôt have a photographic memory so I had no idea who he could be describing. I thanked him for the info and then it came, 

‚ÄúDo you go straight home after this?‚Äù I felt like maybe he was the creep and responded no, that I don‚Äôt go straight home‚Ä¶ and then he asked me ‚ÄúDo you want to go two-steppin?‚Äù I said no, that I‚Äôve got a boyfriend. Which is true. 

So let me get this straight. You‚Äôre going to scare the shit out of me by telling me this concerning information and then ask me out? I can‚Äôt stop thinking about this interaction. Even though I did not go straight home I‚Äôm scared of being assaulted by someone who would follow me home from the gym.

I feel I can‚Äôt go to the gym at night anymore. I‚Äôm really frustrated and frightened by this encounter. I‚Äôm mad because I should be safe regardless of leggings or time of day. I‚Äôm mad because I want to be comfortable when I workout and that will be used against me. I bought pepper spray and won‚Äôt be going at night anymore without my friend.

Edit: Thank you everyone who is sharing support. It means a lot.

UPDATE: I just went to my gym and this man has been reported by multiple staff and members for his creepy and predatory behavior. I filled out an incident report, the very girl who helped me had been approached by him before after work in the parking lot. She said she‚Äôs really gonna push for something to be done.

As surrogacy becomes an easier process, won't it become more exploitative - with lower class women being forced to sacrifice their bodies in order to earn enough money to survive... and as it becomes more popular, won't the price these surrogates are receiving decrease? I've heard that often surrogacy agencies take a huge portion of the money payed anyways, which is fucked up in itself. I'm not saying surrogacy is bad, my mother had a friend who survived stage 4 cancer and could no longer endure pregnancy so she turned to surrogacy for her two youngest. On the other hand, I see a grim future where pregnancy becomes something of the lower class and women are forced to become pregnancy machines in order to combat cost of living. anyways, I hope this didn't come off as shaming anything or anyone, I am not against surrogacy as a whole or anyone who's opted for it.

My name is Charles DeBarber and my org Phoenix Advocates is working on solutions to purge non-consensual sexually explicit content (images or videos) and to provide survivors with legal and mental health resources.

NCII falls into six categories...

1. ""Revenge Porn"" where ex-partners shared sexually explicit content to other parties without consent.
2. ""Data Theft"" where content was stolen from devices, cloud services, hacked accounts, etc.
3. ""Unlawful Surveillance"" where content came from cameras in inappropriate places (e.g. changing rooms) or from ex-partners secretly filming hook-ups.
4. ""Human Trafficking"" is content derived through human trafficking enterprises where deception, fraud, and coercion were used.
5. ""Child Pornography"" is content of minors as no minor can lawfully consent.
6. ""Deep Fakes"" are when fake pornography of survivors is generated using advanced image and video editing techniques.

Our program manager wants to interview survivors anonymously to help understand the needs of survivors in regards to content removal, legal services, and trauma support. Our hope is to create a solution that assists survivors and helps them reclaim their their lives.

I have posted this in r/Feminism as [1 in 8 women](https://cybercivilrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/CCRI-2017-Research-Report.pdf) have either had NCII of them posted or have had an ex-partner threaten to post NCII.

The details are not set in stone yet but the idea is you will have to sign up using your university login and once verified you will be able to add friends, there would be a map similar to snap maps which will share your location only with people in your friends list, this can also be turned off in settings. If you need to walk home at night you can check the app to see if any of your friends are also out that night and then organize to walk home together via the app. 

There will also be a ""people you may know"" section showing people who are walking to the same general area as you (your location will not be visible to these people at any time). This option will have filters so for example you may chose to only look for other women to walk home with.

Is this a solution which you would use?

Is there any features you would add or remove? 

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

So I'm an 18-year-old transgender woman, I'm pre hrt but I'm very feminine so with some gender-neutral clothing and having my long haired open I look pretty androgynous.

There is this very private alley in my town, and I had to take it to get home.
I live in Tehran Iran, and there is a lot of protests against the dictator's regime there are some forces called Basij in the streets these people are the worst human beings they killed a 22-year-old girl over hijab, and then a lot more and then some other 17-year-old girl named Nika Shakarami, and then a 16 year old girl named Sarina Esmail Zadeh and the list goes on.

So on my way back home, which is Tehran's most expensive part and It's supposed to be safe, I must have passed a quiet alley.

I was walking in the ally when I heard the sounds of the fucking Basij motorcycle roaring and entering the alley, I had my hair out and I had very comfortable clothes on, we women of Iran are now protesting a lot and one of the ways is avoiding hijab because we don't want their opinions shoved in us.

So they stopped by me 3 motorcycles and 4 Basij members with batons, I immediately started to shake and I couldn't talk, one of them told me to cover up and I said no and he stroked my knee with the baton I couldn't walk and I started to faint because of the amount of fear I had.

They saw me fall to the ground and I couldn't breathe, so they left me there.
A nice girl who saw me ran towards me and helped me get to my house.

\-Consensually non-monogamous

\-LGBTQ+

\-Kink/BDSM

We look forward to hearing from you about your opinions on what makes ‚Äúgood sex‚Äù ‚Äúgood.‚Äù Please share this survey with your friends and communities so that they can also contribute to the scientific advancement of diversity in understandings of sexuality!

There are very very few women who are not conventionally attractive that become successful in music/film while there are many men who are not conventionally attractive who are on the top of the charts or are allowed to star in big blockbuster movies. 

   Women that don't fit societies impossible standards for beauty will never get as much fame and success as their male counterparts because women are firstly valued for their appearance before anything else. 

   While male actors like Michael Cera or musicians like Jay-Z who are not conventionally attractive get to be respected people in their fields women are not granted the same opportunities if they aren't pretty. It seems as if a woman is not worth her talents if she can't keep a mans attention with her appearance. 

The severity of this changes on what genre of music we are talking about as well because the main perpetrators of this is mainstream pop and rap music. It's so disheartening to know that women like Ariana Grande or Katy Perry would not have been as successful as they are if they were not conventionally attractive.

He wants me to weigh 40 K at least, and for my waistline to measure 20 inchs, I honestly do not know why he is so obsessed with it.

The  podcast  reveals just how little medical science understands the female  body. Astonishingly, it turns out almost everything that we know about  human biology comes from the study of men, male animals and male cell  lines.

And here is a bit about me:  I'm the host of the pod. My  name  is Liz Tucker and I am an award    winning  medical journalist, and  former BBC producer and director. I  have made  films for many of the  world‚Äôs leading broadcasters which  have been shown in over 100  countries.

You can find out more about me and the podcast at [What Your GP Doesn't Tell You](https://www.whatyourgpdoesnttellyou.com/), read my Substack newsletter at [Liz Tucker](https://lizctucker.substack.com/) and follow me on [@lizctucker](https://twitter.com/lizctucker)

So hope you find the pod interesting, would love to hear your thoughts!

I'm a 17 year old girl. I come from a very Christian household. Every single person in the church I'm forced to go to (men and women) are so misogynistic. They say that if you get raped it's your fault if you were wearing revealing clothing. The boys always make jokes about how girls aren't as good as guys in all ways. How we're dumb, and all that shit. The people there think women shouldn't have careers. They think the only thing we're good for is to have kids. They think that we belong to men (our dads until we get married then our husbands) All I've ever heard is how I'm not as good as a man and that i live to please men. I've been in so many situations where I've been followed by creeps at night in my town and been in uncomfortable situations. I work at a grocery store and me and lots of other girls there have had our butts slapped and our hair pulled by old creepy men who think we're they're fucking property. I face sexual harassment every single day. Of course I've told my bosses and everything and even the police but they don't give a flying shit. But it's not only me, it's almost every female in the whole world. Then I go on the internet and all I see is a bunch of men, hundreds of thousands of them supporting hateful creators (I'm talking Andrew Tate, sneako, etc) saying that men have it harder than women and that girls are just a bunch of whiney bitches. All these men on the internet think women just go around accusing men of rape for fun. It's not a wide scale issue of men getting falsely accused. It happens but not as often as getting raped. (I know at least 30 women, myself included, who have been raped). They always talk of double standards against men but when women talk about double standards against us they get pissed. Dear god I'm tired of everything. It feels like being a woman is a fucking curse. Like the whole world's against you.",1665098995.0,2022-10-06 23:29:55+00:00

This has caused my family to always scold me & talk to me about it. Generally, its talks on young women should be calm & soft spoken. Really just ‚Äúthat isn‚Äôt very ladylike!‚Äù A lot of my family gets on me for not being an ideal Filipina. 

However, they let my male cousin be as racist, homophobic, sexist & all around awful as he wants. He says ‚Äújokes‚Äù that he learned from his classmates which is just ham fisted bigotry parading as a joke. Like, literally unprovoked he will spew r/MensRights type takes on feminism (he thinks women are privileged because men can‚Äôt hit them, that women are too sensitive to men invading their personal space, that they don‚Äôt deserve rights & are should be stuck as housewives.) Or say that black people are monkeys, Muslims are terrorists, always trying to say the N word, or that Mexicans are border hopping illegals (I am literally half Mexican, he is fully Filipino from my mothers side. Kicker is that this little shit is only here BECAUSE of being an immigrant too.) Or that gay people should be sent conversion camps. I am a lesbian & he says that he hopes one day I can be forced into being straight. Literally saying as much bigoted shit as possible because he can, especially around me to piss me off. 

He basically sounds like those edgy anti sjw 2017 YouTubers all shoved into the body of a bratty 8th grader. Even when I bring up how concerning & wrong this is to my family (WHO ARE MAINLY WOMEN BY THE WAY) they brush it off as him trying to get a rise out of me & I am taking it too seriously. Meanwhile they are telling me I should be able to be demure & quiet because I am a girl & if I‚Äôm not, I am somehow not a proper young woman. They are so willing to police the things I say to reinforce some old timely traditional bullshit on me while protecting their precious little boy.

First, I got an iud a few months ago. This is an invasive surgery and can be extremely painful and scary, esp for SA victims. Yet all they do for you is tell you to take ibuprofen and you‚Äôll be fine. For a way less invasive and low risk procedure, a vasectomy, men get anti anxiety meds prior (if wanted), local anesthesia, and prescription pain meds after if requested. And yes maybe you could argue with your doctor about pain from an iud, but I‚Äôm guessing it takes justification and explaining, whereas what I‚Äôve seen from mens experience is it‚Äôs no big deal at all the prescribe the medicine for a vasectomy. 

Second, the Pap smear is used to look inside the cervix. It‚Äôs extremely uncomfortable to have that ancient torture looking device get shoved inside of you. I feel like a camera would suffice instead. We use cameras for all sorts of things now but we can‚Äôt for a Pap smear? Even if cameras aren‚Äôt an options why haven‚Äôt we updated it to be more comfortable at all. This seems like an out dated technique, but there‚Äôs no one even working toward development. 

If these both were mens procedures and check ups, I guarantee there would be up to date equipment and procedure and the pain would be taken more seriously.

Edit: I know iud and vasectomy are different types of procedure, my main point is in my experience I have had to argue and explain myself to doctors. Having them ignore and forget to write down crucial information. While I know some men probably experience this too, it seems like I hear more women saying this has happened than men. Science in general is bias and was developed around men, causing a huge gap in knowledge for women‚Äôs health.",1664990094.0,2022-10-05 17:14:54+00:00
